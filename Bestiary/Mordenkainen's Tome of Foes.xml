			<text>The oblex's innate spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 15). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no components:</text>
			<text>3/day each: charm person (as 5th-level spell), color spray, detect thoughts, hold person (as 3rd-level spell)</text>
		</trait>
		<trait>
			<name>Sulfurous Impersonation</name>
			<text>As a bonus action, the oblex can extrude a piece of itself that assumes the appearance of one Medium or smaller creature whose memories it has stolen. This simulacrum appears, feels, and sounds exactly like the creature it impersonates, though it smells faintly of sulfur. The oblex can impersonate 1d4 + 1 different creatures, each one tethered to its body by a strand of slime that can extend up to 120 feet away. For all practical purposes, the simulacrum is the oblex, meaning that the oblex occupies its space and the simulacrum's space simultaneously. The slimy tether is immune to damage, but it is severed if there is no opening at least 1 inch wide between the oblex's main body and the simulacrum. The simulacrum disappears if the tether is severed.</text>

		</action>
		<action>
			<name>Eat Memories</name>
			<text>The oblex targets one creature it can see within 5 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or take 18 (4d8) psychic damage and become memory drained until it finishes a short or long rest or until it benefits from the greater restoration or heal spell. Constructs, oozes, plants, and undead succeed on the save automatically.</text>
			<text>While memory drained, the target must roll a d4 and subtract the number rolled from any ability check or attack roll it makes. Each time the target is memory drained beyond the first, the die size increases by one: the d4 becomes a d6, the d6 becomes a d8, and so on until the die becomes a d20, at which point the target becomes unconscious for 1 hour. The effect then ends.</text>
			<text>When an oblex causes a target to become memory drained, the oblex learns all the languages the target knows and gains all its proficiencies, except for any saving throw proficiencies.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>Unconscious:</text>
			<text>• An unconscious creature is incapacitated, meaning it can't take actions or reactions, can't move or speak, and is unaware of its surroundings.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>• The creature drops whatever it's holding and falls prone.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>• The creature automatically fails Strength and Dexterity saving throws.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>• Attack rolls against the creature have advantage.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>• Any attack that hits the creature is a critical hit if the attacker is within 5 feet of the creature.</text>

		</trait>
		<trait>
			<name>Individual Designs</name>
			<text>A gnome artisan values an individualized clockwork more highly than a perfectly functioning one that copies too much from another creation. For that reason, even clockworks that fit established designs, such as those described here, are seldom identical.</text>
			<text>A clockwork can be customized by adding one of the following enhancements and one potential malfunction to its stat block. You can select randomly or choose a pair of modifications that fit the temperament of the clockwork's builder.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>d10 — Enhancement:</text>
			<text/>
			<text>1 — Camouflaged. The clockwork gains proficiency in Stealth if it doesn't already have it. While motionless, it is indistinguishable from a stopped machine.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>2 — Sensors. The range of the clockwork's darkvision becomes 120 feet, unless it is higher, and it gains proficiency in Perception if it doesn't already have it.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>3 — Improved Armor. The clockwork's AC increases by 2.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>4 — Increased Speed. The clockwork's speed increases by 10 feet.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>5 — Reinforced Construction. The clockwork has resistance to force, lightning, and thunder damage.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>6 — Self-Repairing. If the clockwork starts its turn with at least 1 hit point, it regains 5 hit points. If it takes lightning damage, this ability doesn't function at the start of its next turn.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>7 — Sturdy Frame. The clockwork's hit point maximum increases by an amount equal to its number of Hit Dice.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>8 — Suction. The clockwork gains a climbing speed of 30 feet.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>9 — Vocal Resonator. The clockwork gains the ability to speak rudimentary Common or Gnomish (creator's choice).</text>
			<text/>
			<text>10 — Water Propulsion. The clockwork gains a swimming speed of 30 feet.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>Clockwork Malfunctions:</text>
			<text/>
			<text>d10 — Malfunction</text>
			<text/>
			<text>1 — Faulty Sensors. Roll a d6 at the start of the clockwork's turn. If you roll a 1, the clockwork is blinded until the end of its turn.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>2 — Flawed Targeting. Roll a d6 at the start of the clockwork's turn. If you roll a 1, the clockwork makes attack rolls with disadvantage until the end of its turn.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>3 — Ground Fault. The clockwork has vulnerability to lightning damage.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>4 — Imprinting Loop. Roll a d6 at the start of the clockwork's turn. If you roll a 1, the clockwork mistakes one creature it can see within 30 feet for its creator. The clockwork won't willingly harm that creature for 1 minute or until that creature attacks it or deals damage to it.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>5 — Leaking Lubricant. Roll a d6 at the start of the clockwork's turn. If you roll a 1, the clockwork gains 1 level of exhaustion that it isn't immune to.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>6 — Limited Steering. The clockwork must move in a straight line. It can turn up to 90 degrees before moving and again at the midpoint of its movement. It can rotate freely if it doesn't use any of its speeds on its turn.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>7 — Overactive Sense of Self-Preservation. If the clockwork has half its hit points or fewer at the start of its turn in combat, roll a d6. If you roll a 1, it retreats from combat. If retreat isn't possible, it continues fighting.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>8 — Overheats. Roll a d6 at the start of the clockwork's turn. If you roll a 1, the clockwork is incapacitated until the end of its turn.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>9 — Rusty Gears. The clockwork has disadvantage on initiative rolls, and its speed decreases by 10 feet.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>10 — Weak Armor. The clockwork isn't immune to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks that aren't adamantine.</text>

			<text>When first encountered, a corpse flower contains the corpses of 1d6 + 3 humanoids. A corpse flower can hold the remains of up to nine dead humanoids. These remains have total cover against attacks and other effects outside the corpse flower. If the corpse flower dies, the corpses within it can be pulled free.</text>
			<text>While it has at least one humanoid corpse in its body, the corpse flower can use a bonus action to do one of the following:</text>
			<text/>
			<text>• The corpse flower digests one humanoid corpse in its body and instantly regains 11 (2d10) hit points. Nothing of the digested body remains. Any equipment on the corpse is expelled from the corpse flower in its space.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>• The corpse flower animates one dead humanoid in its body, turning it into a zombie. The zombie appears in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the corpse flower and acts immediately after it in the initiative order. The zombie acts as an ally of the corpse flower but isn't under its control, and the flower's stench clings to it (see the Stench of Death trait).</text>

On a successful save, the creature is immune to the stench of all corpse flowers for 24 hours.</text>

			<name>Gaze</name>
			<text>Demogorgon turns his magical gaze toward one creature that he can see within 120 feet of him. That target must make a DC 23 Wisdom saving throw. Unless the target is incapacitated, it can avert its eyes to avoid the gaze and to automatically succeed on the save. If the target does so, it can't see Demogorgon until the start of his next turn. If the target looks at him in the meantime, it must immediately make the save.</text>
			<text>If the target fails the save, the target suffers one of the following effects of Demogorgon's choice or at random:</text>
			<text>1. Beguiling Gaze: The target is stunned until the start of Demogorgon's next turn or until Demogorgon is no longer within line of sight.</text>
			<text>2. Hypnotic Gaze: The target is charmed by Demogorgon until the start of Demogorgon's next turn. Demogorgon chooses how the charmed target uses its actions, reactions, and movement. Because this gaze requires Demogorgon to focus both heads on the target, he can't use his Maddening Gaze legendary action until the start of his next turn.</text>

			<text>• Demogorgon creates an illusory duplicate of himself, which appears in his own space and lasts until initiative count 20 of the next round. On his turn, Demogorgon can move the illusory duplicate a distance equal to his walking speed (no action required). The first time a creature or object interacts physically with Demogorgon (for example, by hitting him with an attack), there is a 50 percent chance that the illusory duplicate is being affected, not Demogorgon himself, in which case the illusion disappears.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>• Demogorgon casts the darkness spell four times at its lowest level, targeting different areas with the spell. Demogorgon doesn't need to concentrate on the spells, which end on initiative count 20 of the next round.</text>

			<text>The oblex targets one creature it can see within 5 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw or take 44 (8d10) psychic damage and become memory drained until it finishes a short or long rest or until it benefits from the greater restoration or heal spell. Constructs, oozes, plants, and undead succeed on the save automatically.</text>
			<text>While memory drained, the target must roll a d4 and subtract the number rolled from any ability check or attack roll it makes. Each time the target is memory drained beyond the first, the die size increases by one: the d4 becomes a d6, the d6 becomes a d8, and so on until the die becomes a d20, at which point the target becomes unconscious for 1 hour. The effect then ends.</text>
			<text>When an oblex causes a target to become memory drained, the oblex learns all the languages the target knows and gains all its proficiencies, except any saving throw proficiencies.</text>

			<text>Unconscious:</text>

			<text>The hellfire engine moves up to its speed in a straight line. During this move, it can enter Large or smaller creatures' spaces. A creature whose space the hellfire engine enters must make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw. On a successful save, the creature is pushed 5 feet to the nearest space out of the hellfire engine's path. On a failed save, the creature falls prone and takes 28 (8d6) bludgeoning damage.</text>
			<text>If the hellfire engine remains in the prone creature's space, the creature is also restrained until it's no longer in the same space as the hellfire engine. While restrained in this way, the creature, or another creature within 5 feet of it, can make a DC 18 Strength check. On a success, the creature is shunted to an unoccupied space of its choice within 5 feet of the hellfire engine and is no longer restrained.</text>

Creatures that fail the saving throw are drenched in burning acid and take 5 (1d10) fire damage plus 9 (2d8) acid damage at the end of their turns.

			<text>If the chosen option kills a creature, the creature's soul rises from the River Styx as a lemure in Avernus in 1d4 hours. If the creature isn't revived before then, only a wish spell or killing the lemure and casting true resurrection on the creature's original body can restore it to life.

			<text>The iron cobra has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.</text>

		<trait>
			<name>Individual Designs</name>
			<text>A gnome artisan values an individualized clockwork more highly than a perfectly functioning one that copies too much from another creation. For that reason, even clockworks that fit established designs, such as those described here, are seldom identical.</text>
			<text>A clockwork can be customized by adding one of the following enhancements and one potential malfunction to its stat block. You can select randomly or choose a pair of modifications that fit the temperament of the clockwork's builder.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>d10 — Enhancement:</text>
			<text/>
			<text>1 — Camouflaged. The clockwork gains proficiency in Stealth if it doesn't already have it. While motionless, it is indistinguishable from a stopped machine.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>2 — Sensors. The range of the clockwork's darkvision becomes 120 feet, unless it is higher, and it gains proficiency in Perception if it doesn't already have it.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>3 — Improved Armor. The clockwork's AC increases by 2.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>4 — Increased Speed. The clockwork's speed increases by 10 feet.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>5 — Reinforced Construction. The clockwork has resistance to force, lightning, and thunder damage.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>6 — Self-Repairing. If the clockwork starts its turn with at least 1 hit point, it regains 5 hit points. If it takes lightning damage, this ability doesn't function at the start of its next turn.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>7 — Sturdy Frame. The clockwork's hit point maximum increases by an amount equal to its number of Hit Dice.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>8 — Suction. The clockwork gains a climbing speed of 30 feet.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>9 — Vocal Resonator. The clockwork gains the ability to speak rudimentary Common or Gnomish (creator's choice).</text>
			<text/>
			<text>10 — Water Propulsion. The clockwork gains a swimming speed of 30 feet.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>Clockwork Malfunctions:</text>
			<text/>
			<text>d10 — Malfunction</text>
			<text/>
			<text>1 — Faulty Sensors. Roll a d6 at the start of the clockwork's turn. If you roll a 1, the clockwork is blinded until the end of its turn.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>2 — Flawed Targeting. Roll a d6 at the start of the clockwork's turn. If you roll a 1, the clockwork makes attack rolls with disadvantage until the end of its turn.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>3 — Ground Fault. The clockwork has vulnerability to lightning damage.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>4 — Imprinting Loop. Roll a d6 at the start of the clockwork's turn. If you roll a 1, the clockwork mistakes one creature it can see within 30 feet for its creator. The clockwork won't willingly harm that creature for 1 minute or until that creature attacks it or deals damage to it.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>5 — Leaking Lubricant. Roll a d6 at the start of the clockwork's turn. If you roll a 1, the clockwork gains 1 level of exhaustion that it isn't immune to.</text>
			<text/>

			<text>A clockwork doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.</text>
		</trait>
		<trait>
			<name>Magic Resistance</name>
			<text>The oaken bolter has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.</text>
		</trait>
		<trait>
			<name>Individual Designs</name>
			<text>A gnome artisan values an individualized clockwork more highly than a perfectly functioning one that copies too much from another creation. For that reason, even clockworks that fit established designs, such as those described here, are seldom identical.</text>
			<text>A clockwork can be customized by adding one of the following enhancements and one potential malfunction to its stat block. You can select randomly or choose a pair of modifications that fit the temperament of the clockwork's builder.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>d10 — Enhancement:</text>
			<text/>
			<text>1 — Camouflaged. The clockwork gains proficiency in Stealth if it doesn't already have it. While motionless, it is indistinguishable from a stopped machine.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>2 — Sensors. The range of the clockwork's darkvision becomes 120 feet, unless it is higher, and it gains proficiency in Perception if it doesn't already have it.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>3 — Improved Armor. The clockwork's AC increases by 2.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>4 — Increased Speed. The clockwork's speed increases by 10 feet.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>5 — Reinforced Construction. The clockwork has resistance to force, lightning, and thunder damage.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>6 — Self-Repairing. If the clockwork starts its turn with at least 1 hit point, it regains 5 hit points. If it takes lightning damage, this ability doesn't function at the start of its next turn.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>7 — Sturdy Frame. The clockwork's hit point maximum increases by an amount equal to its number of Hit Dice.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>8 — Suction. The clockwork gains a climbing speed of 30 feet.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>9 — Vocal Resonator. The clockwork gains the ability to speak rudimentary Common or Gnomish (creator's choice).</text>
			<text/>
			<text>10 — Water Propulsion. The clockwork gains a swimming speed of 30 feet.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>Clockwork Malfunctions:</text>
			<text/>
			<text>d10 — Malfunction</text>
			<text/>
			<text>1 — Faulty Sensors. Roll a d6 at the start of the clockwork's turn. If you roll a 1, the clockwork is blinded until the end of its turn.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>2 — Flawed Targeting. Roll a d6 at the start of the clockwork's turn. If you roll a 1, the clockwork makes attack rolls with disadvantage until the end of its turn.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>3 — Ground Fault. The clockwork has vulnerability to lightning damage.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>4 — Imprinting Loop. Roll a d6 at the start of the clockwork's turn. If you roll a 1, the clockwork mistakes one creature it can see within 30 feet for its creator. The clockwork won't willingly harm that creature for 1 minute or until that creature attacks it or deals damage to it.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>5 — Leaking Lubricant. Roll a d6 at the start of the clockwork's turn. If you roll a 1, the clockwork gains 1 level of exhaustion that it isn't immune to.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>6 — Limited Steering. The clockwork must move in a straight line. It can turn up to 90 degrees before moving and again at the midpoint of its movement. It can rotate freely if it doesn't use any of its speeds on its turn.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>7 — Overactive Sense of Self-Preservation. If the clockwork has half its hit points or fewer at the start of its turn in combat, roll a d6. If you roll a 1, it retreats from combat. If retreat isn't possible, it continues fighting.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>8 — Overheats. Roll a d6 at the start of the clockwork's turn. If you roll a 1, the clockwork is incapacitated until the end of its turn.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>9 — Rusty Gears. The clockwork has disadvantage on initiative rolls, and its speed decreases by 10 feet.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>10 — Weak Armor. The clockwork isn't immune to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks that aren't adamantine.</text>

The oaken bolter can grapple only one creature at a time.</text>

			<text>The oinoloth touches one willing creature within 5 feet of it. The target regains all its hit points. In addition, the oinoloth can end one disease on the target or remove one of the following conditions from it: blinded, deafened, paralyzed, or poisoned. The target then gains 1 level of exhaustion, and its hit point maximum is reduced by 7 (2d6). This reduction can be removed only by a wish spell or by casting greater restoration on the target three times within the same hour. The target dies if its hit point maximum is reduced to 0.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>Exhaustion:</text>
			<text>Some special abilities and environmental hazards, such as starvation and the long-term effects of freezing or scorching temperatures, can lead to a special condition called exhaustion. Exhaustion is measured in six levels. An effect can give a creature one or more levels of exhaustion, as specified in the effect's description.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>Level — Effect:</text>
			<text>1 —Disadvantage on ability checks</text>
			<text>2 —Speed halved</text>
			<text>3 —Disadvantage on attack rolls and saving throws</text>
			<text>4 —Hit point maximum halved</text>
			<text>5 —Speed reduced to 0</text>
			<text>6 —Death</text>
			<text/>
			<text>If an already exhausted creature suffers another effect that causes exhaustion, its current level of exhaustion increases by the amount specified in the effect's description.</text>
			<text>A creature suffers the effect of its current level of exhaustion as well as all lower levels. For example, a creature suffering level 2 exhaustion has its speed halved and has disadvantage on ability checks.</text>
			<text>An effect that removes exhaustion reduces its level as specified in the effect's description, with all exhaustion effects ending if a creature's exhaustion level is reduced below 1.</text>
			<text>Finishing a long rest reduces a creature's exhaustion level by 1, provided that the creature has also ingested some food and drink.</text>

Alternatively, he can expend or 1 or more of the wand's charges to cast one of the following spells from it: circle of death (1 charge), finger of death (1 charge), or power word kill (2 charges). The wand regains 1d4+3 charges daily at dawn.</text>
			<text>While holding the wand, Orcus can use an action to conjure undead creatures whose combined average hit points don't exceed 500. These undead magically rise up from the ground or otherwise form in unoccupied spaces within 300 feet of Orcus and obey his commands until they are destroyed or until he dismisses them as an action. Once this property of the wand is used, the property can't be used again until the next dawn.</text>

		<action>
			<name>Warp Creature</name>
			<text>The sibriex targets up to three creatures it can see within 120 feet of it. Each target must make a DC 20 Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, a creature becomes immune to this sibriex's Warp Creature. On a failed save, the target is poisoned, which causes it to also gain 1 level of exhaustion. While poisoned in this way, the target must repeat the saving throw at the start of each of its turns. Three successful saves against the poison end it, and ending the poison removes any levels of exhaustion caused by it. Each failed save causes the target to suffer another level of exhaustion. Once the target reaches 6 levels of exhaustion, it dies and instantly transforms into a living abyssal wretch under the sibriex's control. The transformation of the body can be undone only by a wish spell.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>Exhaustion:</text>
			<text>Some special abilities and environmental hazards, such as starvation and the long-term effects of freezing or scorching temperatures, can lead to a special condition called exhaustion. Exhaustion is measured in six levels. An effect can give a creature one or more levels of exhaustion, as specified in the effect's description.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>Level — Effect:</text>
			<text>1 —Disadvantage on ability checks</text>
			<text>2 —Speed halved</text>
			<text>3 —Disadvantage on attack rolls and saving throws</text>
			<text>4 —Hit point maximum halved</text>
			<text>5 —Speed reduced to 0</text>
			<text>6 —Death</text>
			<text/>
			<text>If an already exhausted creature suffers another effect that causes exhaustion, its current level of exhaustion increases by the amount specified in the effect's description.</text>
			<text>A creature suffers the effect of its current level of exhaustion as well as all lower levels. For example, a creature suffering level 2 exhaustion has its speed halved and has disadvantage on ability checks.</text>
			<text>An effect that removes exhaustion reduces its level as specified in the effect's description, with all exhaustion effects ending if a creature's exhaustion level is reduced below 1.</text>
			<text>Finishing a long rest reduces a creature's exhaustion level by 1, provided that the creature has also ingested some food and drink.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>Poisoned:</text>
			<text>• A poisoned creature has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks.</text>
		</action>
		<action>
			<name>Variant: Flesh Warping</name>
			<text>Creatures that encounter a sibriex can be twisted beyond recognition. Whenever a creature fails a saving throw against the sibriex's Warp Creature effect, you can roll percentile dice and consult the Flesh Warping table to determine an additional effect, which vanishes when Warp Creature ends on the creature. If the creature transforms into an abyssal wretch, the effect becomes a permanent feature of that body.</text>
			<text>A creature can willingly submit to flesh warping, an agonizing process that takes at least 1 hour while the creature stays within 30 feet of the sibriex. At the end of the process, roll once on the table (or choose one effect) to determine how the creature is transformed permanently.</text>

			<text/>
			<text>11–15 — The target's hands grow claws, which can be used as daggers.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>16–20 — One of the target's legs grows longer than the other, reducing its walking speed by 10 feet.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>21–25 — The target's eyes become beacons, filling a 15-foot cone with dim light when they are open.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>26–30 — A pair of wings, either feathered or leathery, sprout from the target's back, granting it a flying speed of 30 feet.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>31–35 — The target's ears tear free from its head and scurry away; the target is deafened.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>36–40 — Two of the target's teeth turn into tusks.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>41–45 — The target's skin becomes scabby, granting it a +1 bonus to AC but reducing its Charisma by 2 (to a minimum of 1).</text>
			<text/>
			<text>46–50 — The target's arms and legs switch places, preventing the target from moving unless it crawls.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>51–55 — The target's arms become tentacles with fingers on the ends, increasing its reach by 5 feet.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>56–60 — The target's legs grow incredibly long and springy, increasing its walking speed by 10 feet.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>61–65 — The target grows a whiplike tail, which it can use as a whip.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>66–70 — The target's eyes turn black, and it gains darkvision out to a range of 120 feet.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>71–75 — The target swells, tripling its weight.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>76–80 — The target becomes thin and skeletal, halving its weight.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>81–85 — The target's head doubles in size.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>86–90 — The target's ears become wings, giving it a flying speed of 5 feet.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>91–95 — The target's body becomes unusually brittle, causing the target to have vulnerability to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>96–00 — The target grows another head, causing it to have advantage on saving throws against being charmed, frightened, or stunned.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>Deafened:</text>
			<text>• A deafened creature can't hear and automatically fails any ability check that requires hearing.</text>

			<text/>
			<text>Exhaustion:</text>
			<text>Some special abilities and environmental hazards, such as starvation and the long-term effects of freezing or scorching temperatures, can lead to a special condition called exhaustion. Exhaustion is measured in six levels. An effect can give a creature one or more levels of exhaustion, as specified in the effect's description.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>Level — Effect:</text>
			<text>1 —Disadvantage on ability checks</text>
			<text>2 —Speed halved</text>
			<text>3 —Disadvantage on attack rolls and saving throws</text>
			<text>4 —Hit point maximum halved</text>
			<text>5 —Speed reduced to 0</text>
			<text>6 —Death</text>
			<text/>
			<text>If an already exhausted creature suffers another effect that causes exhaustion, its current level of exhaustion increases by the amount specified in the effect's description.</text>
			<text>A creature suffers the effect of its current level of exhaustion as well as all lower levels. For example, a creature suffering level 2 exhaustion has its speed halved and has disadvantage on ability checks.</text>
			<text>An effect that removes exhaustion reduces its level as specified in the effect's description, with all exhaustion effects ending if a creature's exhaustion level is reduced below 1.</text>
			<text>Finishing a long rest reduces a creature's exhaustion level by 1, provided that the creature has also ingested some food and drink.</text>

			<text>A clockwork doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.</text>

			<text>While the stone defender remains motionless against an uneven earthen or stone surface, it is indistinguishable from that surface.</text>

			<text>The stone defender has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.</text>

		<trait>
			<name>Individual Designs</name>
			<text>A gnome artisan values an individualized clockwork more highly than a perfectly functioning one that copies too much from another creation. For that reason, even clockworks that fit established designs, such as those described here, are seldom identical.</text>
			<text>A clockwork can be customized by adding one of the following enhancements and one potential malfunction to its stat block. You can select randomly or choose a pair of modifications that fit the temperament of the clockwork's builder.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>d10 — Enhancement:</text>
			<text/>
			<text>1 — Camouflaged. The clockwork gains proficiency in Stealth if it doesn't already have it. While motionless, it is indistinguishable from a stopped machine.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>2 — Sensors. The range of the clockwork's darkvision becomes 120 feet, unless it is higher, and it gains proficiency in Perception if it doesn't already have it.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>3 — Improved Armor. The clockwork's AC increases by 2.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>4 — Increased Speed. The clockwork's speed increases by 10 feet.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>5 — Reinforced Construction. The clockwork has resistance to force, lightning, and thunder damage.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>6 — Self-Repairing. If the clockwork starts its turn with at least 1 hit point, it regains 5 hit points. If it takes lightning damage, this ability doesn't function at the start of its next turn.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>7 — Sturdy Frame. The clockwork's hit point maximum increases by an amount equal to its number of Hit Dice.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>8 — Suction. The clockwork gains a climbing speed of 30 feet.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>9 — Vocal Resonator. The clockwork gains the ability to speak rudimentary Common or Gnomish (creator's choice).</text>
			<text/>
			<text>10 — Water Propulsion. The clockwork gains a swimming speed of 30 feet.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>Clockwork Malfunctions:</text>
			<text/>
			<text>d10 — Malfunction</text>
			<text/>
			<text>1 — Faulty Sensors. Roll a d6 at the start of the clockwork's turn. If you roll a 1, the clockwork is blinded until the end of its turn.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>2 — Flawed Targeting. Roll a d6 at the start of the clockwork's turn. If you roll a 1, the clockwork makes attack rolls with disadvantage until the end of its turn.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>3 — Ground Fault. The clockwork has vulnerability to lightning damage.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>4 — Imprinting Loop. Roll a d6 at the start of the clockwork's turn. If you roll a 1, the clockwork mistakes one creature it can see within 30 feet for its creator. The clockwork won't willingly harm that creature for 1 minute or until that creature attacks it or deals damage to it.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>5 — Leaking Lubricant. Roll a d6 at the start of the clockwork's turn. If you roll a 1, the clockwork gains 1 level of exhaustion that it isn't immune to.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>6 — Limited Steering. The clockwork must move in a straight line. It can turn up to 90 degrees before moving and again at the midpoint of its movement. It can rotate freely if it doesn't use any of its speeds on its turn.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>7 — Overactive Sense of Self-Preservation. If the clockwork has half its hit points or fewer at the start of its turn in combat, roll a d6. If you roll a 1, it retreats from combat. If retreat isn't possible, it continues fighting.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>8 — Overheats. Roll a d6 at the start of the clockwork's turn. If you roll a 1, the clockwork is incapacitated until the end of its turn.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>9 — Rusty Gears. The clockwork has disadvantage on initiative rolls, and its speed decreases by 10 feet.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>10 — Weak Armor. The clockwork isn't immune to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks that aren't adamantine.</text>

			<name>Earth-Shaking Movement</name>
			<text>As a bonus action after moving at least 10 feet on the ground, the zaratan can send a shock wave through the ground in a 120-foot-radius circle centered on itself. That area becomes difficult terrain for 1 minute. Each creature on the ground that is concentrating must succeed on a DC 25 Constitution saving throw or the creature's concentration is broken.</text>
			<text>The shock wave deals 100 thunder damage to all structures in contact with the ground in the area. If a creature is near a structure that collapses, the creature might be buried; a creature within half the distance of the structure's height must make a DC 25 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 17 (5d6) bludgeoning damage, is knocked prone, and is trapped in the rubble. A trapped creature is restrained, requiring a successful DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check as an action to escape. Another creature within 5 feet of the buried creature can use its action to clear rubble and grant advantage on the check. If three creatures use their actions in this way, the check is an automatic success. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and doesn't fall prone or become trapped.</text>
