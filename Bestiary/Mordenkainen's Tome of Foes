		<description>
			<text>When a mind uncovers a secret that a powerful being has protected with a mighty curse, the result is often the emergence of an allip.  Secrets protected in this manner range in scope from a demon lord's true name ot the hidden truths of the cosmic order.  The allip acquires the secret, but the curse annihilates its body and leaves behind a spectral creature composed of fragments from the victim's psyche and overwhelming psychic agony.</text>
			<text>Blasphemous Secrets.  Every allip is wracked with a horrifying insight that torments what remains of its mind.  In the presence of other creatures, an allip seeks to relieve this burden by sharing its secret.  The creature can impart only a shard of the knowledge that doomed it, but tha tpiece is enough to wrack the recipient with temporary madness.  The survivors of an allip's attack are sometimes left witha compulsion to learn more about what spawned this monstrosity.  Strange phrases echo through their minds, and weird visions occupy their dreams.  The sense t hat some clossal truth sits just outside their recall plagues them for days, months, and sometimes years after their fateful encounter.</text>
			<text>Undead Nature.  An allip doesn't require air, food, drink or sleep.</text>

			<text>Any creature or object that the astral dreadnought swallows is transported to a demiplane that can be entered by no other means except a wish spell or this creature’s Donjon Visit ability. A creature can leave the demiplane only by using magic that enables planar travel, such as the plane shift spell. The demiplane resembles a stone cave roughly 1,000 feet in diameter with a ceiling 100 feet high. Like a stomach, it contains the remains of the dreadnought’s past meals. The dreadnought can’t be harmed from within the demiplane. If the dreadnought dies, the demiplane disappears, and everything inside it appears around the corpse.

			<name>Lair Actions</name>
			<text>When fighting inside its lair, a balhannoth can use lair actions. On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), a balhannoth can take one lair action to cause one of the following effects; the balhannoth can’t use the same lair action two rounds in a row:
The balhannoth warps reality around it in an area up to 500 feet square. After 10 minutes, the terrain in the area reshapes to assume the appearance of a location sought by one intelligent creature whose mind the balhannoth has read (see Regional Effects below). The transformation affects nonliving material only and can’t create anything with moving parts or magical properties. Any object created in this area is, upon close inspection, revealed as a fake. Books are filled with empty pages, golden items are obvious counterfeits, and so on. The transformation lasts until the balhannoth dies or uses this lair action again.
The balhannoth targets one creature within 500 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or the target, along with whatever it is wearing and carrying, teleports to an unoccupied space of the balhannoth’s choice within 60 feet of it.
The balhannoth targets one creature within 500 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or the balhannoth becomes invisible to that creature for 1 minute. This effect ends if the balhannoth attacks the target.</text>
		</legendary>
		<legendary>
			<name>Regional Effects</name>
			<text>A region containing a balhannoth’s lair becomes warped by the creature’s unnatural presence, which creates one or more of the following effects:
Creatures within 1 mile of the balhannoth’s lair experience a sensation of being close to whatever they desire most. The sensation grows stronger the closer the creatures come to the balhannoth’s lair.
The balhannoth can sense the strongest desires of any humanoid within 1 mile of it and learns whether those desires involve a place: a safe location to rest, a temple, home, or somewhere else.
If the balhannoth dies, these effects end immediately.</text>

			<name>Spectral Duplicate (1/Short or Long Rest)</name>
			<text>As a bonus action, the berbalang creates one spectral duplicate of itself in an unoccupied space it can see within 60 feet of it. While the duplicate exists, the berbalang is unconscious. A berbalang can have only one duplicate at a time. The duplicate disappears when it or the berbalang drops to 0 hit points or when the berbalang dismisses it (no action required).   
The duplicate has the same statistics and knowledge as the berbalang, and everything experienced by the duplicate is known by the berbalang. All damage dealt by the duplicate’s attacks is psychic damage.</text>
		</trait>
		<trait>
			<name>Innate Spellcasting</name>
			<text>The berbalang’s innate spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 13). The berbalang can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:
At will: speak with dead
1/day: plane shift (self only)</text>
		</trait>
		<trait>
			<name>Speakers of the Dead.</name>
			<text>Berbalangs prefer to speak only to dead things, and specifically only to the spirits they call forth in the hope of learning secrets. They record their stories on the bones that once belonged to these creatures, thus preserving the information they gain.</text>
		</trait>
		<trait>
			<name>Spectral Spy</name>
			<text>The pursuit of knowledge drives everything berbalangs do. Although they mostly learn their secrets from the dead, they aren’t above spying on the living to take knowledge from them as well. A berbalang can create a spectral duplicate of itself and send the duplicate out to gather information on other planes by watching places where the gods and their servants gather. When a berbalang is perceiving its environment through its duplicate, its actual body is unconscious and can’t protect or nourish itself. Thus, a berbalang typically uses its duplicate for only a short time before returning its consciousness to its body.</text>
		</trait>
		<trait>
			<name>Weird Oracles</name>
			<text>The knowledge that berbalangs accumulate makes them great sources of information for powerful people traveling the planes. Berba­langs ignore petitioners, however, unless they come bearing a choice secret or the bones of a particularly interesting creature. Githyanki have found a way to coexist with berbalangs, and sometimes use the creatures to spy on their enemies and to watch over their crèches on the Material Plane.</text>

When a target presents itself, the choker’s starfish-shaped hands dart out of its hiding spot, wrap around the victim’s throat, and pin the unfortunate creature against the cavern wall while choking out its life.

Enhancement
1
Camouflaged. The clockwork gains proficiency in Stealth if it doesn’t already have it. While motionless, it is indistinguishable from a stopped machine.
2
Sensors. The range of the clockwork’s darkvision becomes 120 feet, unless it is higher, and it gains proficiency in Perception if it doesn’t already have it.
3
Improved Armor. The clockwork’s AC increases by 2.
4
Increased Speed. The clockwork’s speed increases by 10 feet.
5
Reinforced Construction. The clockwork has resistance to force, lightning, and thunder damage.
6
Self-Repairing. If the clockwork starts its turn with at least 1 hit point, it regains 5 hit points. If it takes lightning damage, this ability doesn’t function at the start of its next turn.
7
Sturdy Frame. The clockwork’s hit point maximum increases by an amount equal to its number of Hit Dice.
8
Suction. The clockwork gains a climbing speed of 30 feet.
9
Vocal Resonator. The clockwork gains the ability to speak rudimentary Common or Gnomish (creator’s choice).
10
Water Propulsion. The clockwork gains a swimming speed of 30 feet.</text>

Malfunction
1
Faulty Sensors. Roll a d6 at the start of the clockwork’s turn. If you roll a 1, the clockwork is blinded until the end of its turn.
2
Flawed Targeting. Roll a d6 at the start of the clockwork’s turn. If you roll a 1, the clockwork makes attack rolls with disadvantage until the end of its turn.
3
Ground Fault. The clockwork has vulnerability to lightning damage.
4
Imprinting Loop. Roll a d6 at the start of the clockwork’s turn. If you roll a 1, the clockwork mistakes one creature it can see within 30 feet for its creator. The clockwork won’t willingly harm that creature for 1 minute or until that creature attacks it or deals damage to it.
5
Leaking Lubricant. Roll a d6 at the start of the clockwork’s turn. If you roll a 1, the clockwork gains 1 level of exhaustion that it isn’t immune to.
6
Limited Steering. The clockwork must move in a straight line. It can turn up to 90 degrees before moving and again at the midpoint of its movement. It can rotate freely if it doesn’t use any of its speeds on its turn.
7
Overactive Sense of Self-Preservation. If the clockwork has half its hit points or fewer at the start of its turn in combat, roll a d6. If you roll a 1, it retreats from combat. If retreat isn’t possible, it continues fighting.
8
Overheats. Roll a d6 at the start of the clockwork’s turn. If you roll a 1, the clockwork is incapacitated until the end of its turn.
9
Rusty Gears. The clockwork has disadvantage on initiative rolls, and its speed decreases by 10 feet.
10
Weak Armor. The clockwork isn’t immune to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks that aren’t adamantine.</text>

The corpse flower animates one dead humanoid in its body, turning it into a zombie. The zombie appears in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the corpse flower and acts immediately after it in the initiative order.

			<text>Though deathlocks exist to serve their patrons, they retain some freedom when it comes to devising particular tactics and carrying out their plans. Powerful deathlocks recruit lesser creatures to help them carry out their missions and, in this capacity, become the masterminds behind vast conspiracies and intrigues that culminate in the accomplishment of great acts of evil.
			The forging of a pact between a warlock and a patron is no minor occasion — at least not for the warlock. The consequences of breaking that pact can be dire and, in some cases, lethal. A warlock who fails to live up to a bargain with an evil patron runs the risk of rising from the dead as a deathlock, a foul undead driven to serve its otherworldly patron from beyond the grave.
An extraordinarily powerful necromancer might also discover the dark methods of creating a deathlock and then bind it to service, acting in this respect as the deathlock’s patron.
Obedient and Obsessed. An overpowering urge to serve consumes the mind of a newly awakened deathlock. All goals and ambitions it had in life that don’t please its patron fall away as its master’s desires become the purpose that drives the deathlock. The creature immediately resumes work on its patron’s behalf. Accomplishing a difficult goal might mean the deathlock is forced to serve another powerful creature or might entail in gathering servants of its own.
Whatever the goal, it always reflects the patron’s interests, ranging from small-scale concerns to matters of cosmic scope. A deathlock in the thrall of a fiend might work to destroy a specific temple dedicated to a good god, while one that serves a Great Old One could be charged with hunting for the materials needed to call forth a horrifying entity into the world.</text>

			<text>An alkilith is easily mistaken for some kind of foul fungal growth that appears on doorways, windows, and other portals. These dripping infestations conceal the demonic nature of the alkilith, making what should be a dire warning appear strange but otherwise innocuous. Wherever alkiliths take root, they weaken the fabric of reality, creating a portal through which even nastier demons can invade.
Symptoms of Doom. The appearance of an alkilith in the world heralds a great wrongness and an imminent catastrophe. An alkilith searches for an aperture such as a window or a door around which it can take root, stretching its body around the opening and anchoring itself with a sticky secretion. If left undisturbed, the opening becomes attuned to the Abyss and eventually becomes a portal to that plane (see “Planar Portals” in chapter 2 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide).
Spawn of Juiblex. Alkiliths spring from the cast-off bits of Juiblex’s hideous, shuddering body, then gradually become self-aware and set out to find their way onto the Material Plane. Since most cultists consider them too risky for summoning — they can, after all, create portals to the Abyss — alkiliths must find other escape routes out of their native plane.</text>

Whether being controlled by more powerful demons or charging into battle for the sake of it, armanites use their claws, hooves, and long, whiplike tails to tear apart their foes.
Live for War. In the armies of the demon lords, armanites perform the role of heavy cavalry, leading the charge and tearing into their enemies’ flanks. Armanites fight all the time, even among themselves if they can’t find another enemy. They make ideal shock troops, courageous to the point of stupidity and utterly savage.
Walking Arsenal. Part of what makes armanites so fearsome is the number of weapons they have at their disposal. They possess sharp hooves, claws that end in curling talons, and long, serrated tails that can flense the flesh from a victim, and they use them all to carve through their foes. When they are up against tough formations, they can call on their innate magic to loose bolts of lightning and blow holes in the enemy ranks.</text>

Bloodlust. Bulezaus crave violence. Their eagerness to kill and willingness to die make them common members of any demon lord’s entourage. When not being corralled by larger and tougher demons, bulezaus gather into scrabbling mobs, wrestling and fighting among themselves until a better target comes along or until a stronger demon bullies them into subservience.
Repulsive. Disfiguring ailments plague bulezaus: crusted eyes, maggots wriggling in open sores, and a reek of rotten meat that follows them wherever they go.</text>

			<name>Dybbuk</name>
			<text>Dybbuks terrorize mortals on the Material Plane by possessing corpses and giving them a semblance of life, after which the demons use them to engage in a range of sordid activities.
Puppet Masters. In their natural form, dybbuks appear as translucent flying jellyfish, trailing long tendrils as they move through the air. They rarely travel in this fashion, however. Instead, a dybbuk possesses the first suitable corpse it finds, rousing the body from death so it can then indulge its hideous vices.
Dark Masquerade. By plundering a corpse’s memories and accessing its capabilities, a dybbuk can impersonate the creature as it was in life. But the truth of the matter quickly becomes apparent to those around it, because a dybbuk can’t resist pursuing its vices with a maniacal single-mindedness that betrays its true nature. Dybbuks delight in terrorizing other creatures by making their host bodies behave in horrifying ways — throwing up gouts of blood, excreting piles of squirming maggots, and contorting their limbs in impossible ways as they scuttle across the ground.</text>

			<name>Maurezhi</name>
			<text>When Doresain, the King of Ghouls, corrupted a society of elves, he created a new breed of demons to lead packs of ghouls and ghasts in the material world.
Horrid Infiltrators. When a maurezhi consumes the corpse of a humanoid it has slain — a process that takes about 10 minutes — it instantly assumes the creature’s appearance as it was in life. The new appearance begins to rot away over the next few days, eventually revealing the demon’s original form.
A Plague of Ghouls. Maurezhi are contagion incarnate. Their bite attacks can drain a victim’s sense of self. If this affliction is allowed to go far enough, the victim is infected with an unholy hunger for flesh that overpowers their personality and transforms them into a ghoul.</text>

		<legendary>
			<name>Molydeus</name>
			<text>The most ruthless and dangerous of demons — more feared than the dreaded balor — the molydeus speaks with the authority of the demon lord it serves as it enforces its master’s will. Standing some 12 feet tall, a molydeus has a red-skinned, humanoid body and two heads — one that of a slavering wolf and the other that of a serpent with dripping fangs perched atop a long neck. Molydei might guard their masters’ possessions, roam the battlefields of the Abyss to ensure the loyalty of troops, or bring swift death to their enemies.
Branded and Bound. When a demon earns the attention of a demon lord through ferocity, cunning, or an act of surprising devotion, the demon lord might reward such service by snatching up the fiend and subjecting it to excruciating torments to remake it into a molydeus.
Voice of the Master. A demon lord has a direct link to its molydeus and uses the serpent head to communicate its wishes. A molydeus is, therefore, said to utter its master’s will, commanding other demons to carry out orders and using violence to ensure they obey. A molydeus must constantly be ready for the scrutiny of its master, for the demon lord can decide at any moment to observe the molydeus through the serpent. Thus, there is no room for treachery in a molydeus.
Special Weapon. As part of a demon lord’s trust in its molydeus, it bestows a powerful weapon upon the guardian demon. The demon lord fashions the weapon from a portion of the fiend’s essence, so that the demon and its weapon are forever bound. If the molydeus dies, the weapon dissolves into a pool of foul-smelling slime. It’s possible to steal such a weapon, but a molydeus deprived of its weapon will stop at nothing to regain it.
The weapon a molydeus wields reflects the nature of its master. Those that serve Baphomet carry a glaive; Demogorgon, a whip; Fraz-Urb’luu, a battleaxe; Graz’zt, a greatsword; Orcus, a morningstar; and Yeenoghu, a flail. The weapon’s form doesn’t affect its capabilities.
Dark Guardians. One of the chief tasks of any molydeus is to help protect its master’s amulet — the most prized possession of any demon lord. Each of these dangerous relics allows a demon lord to return to life in the Abyss if the unthinkable occurs and its abyssal form is destroyed. As useful as these amulets are, they are also liabilities — because, armed with an amulet, a creature can coerce the demon lord to which it belongs into doing its bidding, or can strand it in the Abyss if the amulet is destroyed.</text>

			<text>You can give a molydeus the ability to summon other demons.
Summon Demon (1/Day). As an action, the molydeus has a 50 percent chance of summoning its choice of 1d6 babaus, 1d4 chasmes, or one marilith. A summoned demon appears in an unoccupied space within 60 feet of the molydeus, acts as an ally of the molydeus, and can’t summon other demons. It remains for 1 minute, until it or the molydeus dies, or until the molydeus dismisses it as an action.</text>

			<text>The insatiable nabassus prowl the multiverse in search of souls to devour. If they think they can kill a creature and consume its soul, they attack — even if that other creature is a demon, including another nabassu.
Hated Outcasts. Demons have few rules, and the murder of other demons hardly raises an eyebrow among these fiends. The act of devouring souls is something else. For this reason, most demons shun nabassus and force them to live on the fringes of the Abyss. There, nabassus pick off weaker demons or, if the situation warrants, gather in packs to take down larger prey. Some especially powerful nabassus even search for demon lords’ amulets.
Demonic Infiltrators. Whenever magic pulls demons from the Abyss to the Material Plane, nabassus try to get summoned so that they can embark on a feast of souls there. If a nabassu is summoned, it tries to break free so that it can devour the soul of its summoner and then set out to feed on the souls of whatever creatures it can catch. One way a summoner can avoid this fate is by providing a steady supply of souls to the nabassu, which can cause the demon to be cooperative — for as long as the supply lasts.</text>

			<text>Thought to be as old as the Abyss itself, sibriexes haunt remote parts of the plane, where they use their vile abilities to breed new horrors and apprehend forbidden lore. Rivulets of blood and bile cascade from a sibriex’s body. Where these noxious fluids hit the ground, the landscape becomes polluted.
Keepers of Forbidden Lore. Sibriexes have spent eons amassing information from across the planes, hoarding knowledge for when it might be useful. Such is their incredible intellect that many seek them out, including demon lords. Some sibriexes act as advisors and oracles, manipulating demons into serving their ends, while other sibriexes cling to their secrets, parceling out lore only when doing so would advance their plans.
Demon Crafters. Sibriexes can channel the power of the Abyss to create new demons from other creatures. Over the course of days, they can create vast numbers of rutterkins to protect their lands and to ensure that the plane teems with destructive monsters. Some demons petition sibriexes for physical gifts, and if they are moved to do so, sibriexes can graft on new body parts to give the demons greater strength, vision, or stamina. Sibriexes never give aid freely; they demand a service or a treasure in return for the flesh-shaping they provide.
Variant: Flesh Warping
Creatures that encounter a sibriex can be twisted beyond recognition. Whenever a creature fails a saving throw against the sibriex’s Warp Creature effect, you can roll percentile dice and consult the Flesh Warping table to determine an additional effect, which vanishes when Warp Creature ends on the creature. If the creature transforms into an abyssal wretch, the effect becomes a permanent feature of that body.
A creature can willingly submit to flesh warping, an agonizing process that takes at least 1 hour while the creature stays within 30 feet of the sibriex. At the end of the process, roll once on the table (or choose one effect) to determine how the creature is transformed permanently.</text>

			<text>At the start of each of the wastrilith’s turns, exposed water within 30 feet of it is befouled. Underwater, this effect lightly obscures the area until a current clears it away. Water in containers remains corrupted until it evaporates.
A creature that consumes this foul water or swims in it must make a DC 18 Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, the creature is immune to the foul water for 24 hours. On a failed save, the creature takes 14 (4d6) poison damage and is poisoned for 1 minute. At the end of this time, the poisoned creature must repeat the saving throw. On a failure, the creature takes 18 (4d8) poison damage and is poisoned until it finishes a long rest.
If another demon drinks the foul water as an action, it gains 11 (2d10) temporary hit points.</text>

			<text>The wastrilith magically launches a spout of water at one creature it can see within 60 feet of it. The target must make a DC 17 Strength saving throw, and it has disadvantage if it’s underwater. On a failed save, it takes 22 (4d8 + 4) acid damage and is pulled up to 60 feet toward the wastrilith. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage and isn’t pulled.</text>

			<name>Wastrilith</name>
			<text>Found in the waters of the Abyss and other bodies of water contaminated by the plane’s fell influence, wastriliths establish themselves as lords of the deep and rule their dominions with cruelty.
Despoilers. A wastrilith contaminates the waters around it. Its noxious presence even affects nearby sources of water when the demon travels on land. The corrupted water, which contains a measure of the demon’s essence, responds to its commands — perhaps hardening to prevent foes from escaping, or erupting in a surge that drags would-be victims into its reach.
Silent Corrupters. Creatures that ingest water that has been corrupted by a wastrilith risk their very souls. Those who drink the poisonous liquid might wither away until they finally die, or remain alive only to become a thrall of chaos and evil. To represent this defilement, you can use the optional rule on abyssal corruption in chapter 2 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide, causing the poisoned creature to be corrupted.</text>

			<text>Each abishai was once a mortal who somehow won Tiamat’s favor before death and, as a reward, found its soul transformed into a hideous devil to serve at her pleasure in the Nine Hells.
Emissaries of Doom. Tiamat deploys abishais as emissaries, sending them to represent her interests in the Hells and across the multiverse. Some have simple tasks, such as delivering a message to cultists or taking charge of worshipers to carry out a sensitive mission. Others have greater responsibilities, such as leading large groups, assassinating targets, and serving in armies. In all cases, abishais are fanatically loyalty to Tiamat, ready to lay down their lives if needed.
Outsiders in Hell. Abishais stand outside the normal hierarchy of the Nine Hells, having their own chain of command and ultimately answering to Tiamat (and Asmodeus, when the dark lord chooses to use them). Other archdevils can command abishais to work for them, but most archdevils do so rarely, since it is never clear whether an abishai follows Tiamat’s orders or Asmodeus’s. There is inherent risk in countermanding an order given by Tiamat, but interfering with Asmodeus’s plans invites certain destruction.</text>

			<name>Flesh-Crushing Stride</name>
			<text>The hellfire engine moves up to its speed in a straight line. During this move, it can enter Large or smaller creatures’ spaces. A creature whose space the hellfire engine enters must make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw. On a successful save, the creature is pushed 5 feet to the nearest space out of the hellfire engine’s path. On a failed save, the creature falls prone and takes 28 (8d6) bludgeoning damage.
If the hellfire engine remains in the prone creature’s space, the creature is also restrained until it’s no longer in the same space as the hellfire engine. While restrained in this way, the creature, or another creature within 5 feet of it, can make a DC 18 Strength check.

Creatures that fail the saving throw are drenched in burning acid and take 5 (1d10) fire damage plus 9 (2d8) acid damage at the end of their turns.

Up to three other creatures of the hellfire engine’s choice that it can see within 30 feet of the target must each make a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw, taking 22 (5d8) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</text>

			<name>Thunder Cannon</name>
			<text>The hellfire engine targets a point within 120 feet of it that it can see. Each creature within 30 feet of that point must make a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw, taking 27 (5d10) bludgeoning damage plus 13 (2d12) thunder damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
If the chosen option kills a creature, the creature’s soul rises from the River Styx as a lemure in Avernus in 1d4 hours. If the creature isn’t revived before then, only a wish spell or killing the lemure and casting true resurrection on the creature’s original body can restore it to life.

			<name>Hellfire Engine</name>
			<text>Hellfire engines are semiautonomous bringers of destruction. Amnizus and other devilish generals hold them in reserve until they are needed to repel an incursion by demons or crusading mortals, but occasionally one of these mechanical and magical hybrids gets loose, driven berserk by its need to destroy.
Many Forms, One Purpose. Hellfire engines take many forms, but all of them have one purpose: to mow down foes in waves. They are incapable of subtlety or trickery, but their destructive capability is immense.
Soul Trapping. Mortal creatures slain by hellfire engines are doomed to join the infernal legions in mere hours unless powerful magic-wielders intervene on their behalf. The archdukes would like nothing better than to modify this magic so it works against demons, too, but that discovery has eluded them so far.
Constructed Nature. A hellfire engine doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.</text>

Masks of Uniformity. Merregons have no individuality, and hence no need for faces. Every merregon legionnaire has a metal mask bolted to its head. Markings on the mask indicate the only elements of the wearer’s identity that matter: its commander and the layer of the Nine Hells it serves.
Fearless Obedience. Because of their unshakable loyalty, merregons form the backbone of many devils’ protective retinues. They shrink from no task, no matter how dangerous. Unless ordered to fall back, they retreat from no fight.</text>

			<name>Narzugon</name>
			<text>Paladins who make deals with devils and carry their twisted sense of honor into the afterlife are especially valuable to the archdukes of the Nine Hells, who want unquestioning champions to lead their legions in war. These narzugons, wielding lances of hellfire and riding nightmare steeds like horrific perversions of knights errant, roam across the infernal layers and other planes to carry out the will of their masters.
Death in Hellfire. A narzugon’s lances are forged in hellfire. The soul of anyone killed by such a lance is shunted to the River Styx for rebirth as a lemure. Each lance is unique to its owner, bearing the marks of both the narzugon and its master.
Nightmare Riders. Each narzugon claims a nightmare as its mount. These nightmares are bound by infernal tack (see the sidebar) and must respond to summons and commands from the wearer of the spurs.</text>
		</legendary>
		<legendary>
			<name>Infernal Tack (Magic Item)</name>
			<text>Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement by a creature of evil alignment)
A narzugon binds a nightmare to its service with infernal tack, which consists of a bridle, bit, reins, saddle, stirrups, and spurs. A nightmare equipped with infernal tack must serve whoever wears the spurs until the wearer dies or the tack is removed.
You can use an action to call a nightmare equipped with infernal tack by clashing the spurs together or scraping them through blood. The nightmare appears at the start of your next turn, within 20 feet of you. It acts as your ally and takes its turn on your initiative count. It remains for 1 day, until you or it dies, or until you dismiss it as an action. If the nightmare dies, it reforms in the Nine Hells within 24 hours, after which you can summon it again.
The tack doesn’t conjure a nightmare from thin air; one must first be subdued so the tack can be placed on it. No nightmare accepts this forced servitude willingly, but some eventually form strong loyalties to their masters and become true partners in evil.</text>

			<name>Nupperibo</name>
			<text>No soul is turned away from the Nine Hells, but the truly worthless — those whose evil acts in life arose from carelessness and sloth more than anything else — are suitable only to become nupperibos. These pitiful creatures shuffle mindlessly across the landscape: blind, bloated from unquenchable hunger, and groping for whatever scraps of fetid matter or swarming vermin they can scoop into their groaning mouths.
Nauseating Bulk. Individually, nupperibos are pathetic, but they’re rarely alone and can be dangerous when gathered into packs. They herd together into throngs that can clog a vital passage or an entire valley. Clouds of stinging insects, stirges, and other vermin surround them in a terrifying, reeking sheath that torments any non-devil that draws near.
Hunger Unending. A nupperibo knows nothing but the hunger that propels it on a blind quest for anything to devour. Once it senses a potential meal, it pursues that prey tirelessly until the food is consumed, the nupperibo is slain, or some other morsel crosses the fiend’s path and distracts it.
Slavish Obedience. With no interest of its own beyond the need to consume, a nupperibo obeys unthinkingly any command it receives telepathically from another devil. This blind loyalty makes them the easiest of infernal troops to lead into battle, but their presence in a legion does nothing to elevate its general’s status.</text>

			<text>When an archduke of the Nine Hells needs a creature tracked, found, and either done away with or captured, the task usually falls to an orthon. Orthons are infernal bounty hunters, tireless in their pursuit of their quarry across the multiverse.
Unseen and All-Seeing. Orthons are infamous for their sharp senses. Because an orthon can become invisible at will, its quarry is often unaware of being hunted until the orthon strikes. The orthon’s invisibility can be disrupted when the devil is attacked, however, so a strong counterattack is often the best defense against it.
A Sporting Chance. Orthons value the challenge of the chase and the thrill of one-on-one combat above all else. An orthon’s first loyalty is to its archduke, but if it has no immediate assignment, an orthon might work for anyone who offers it the promise of a worthy struggle against a lethal foe. Because they travel widely, orthons are unequaled as guides through the layers of the Nine Hells.</text>

			<name>Bael</name>
			<text>With the Blood War raging for eons and no end in sight, opportunities abound for ambitious archdevils to win fame, glory, and power in the ongoing struggle against the demons. Duke Bael, one of Mammon’s most important vassals, has won fame and acclaim for his victories. Charged with leading sixty-six companies of barbed devils, Bael has proven to be a tactical genius, earning esteem for himself and his master as a result of victory after victory over the abyssal host. Mammon relies on Bael, because of his battle acumen, to safeguard his holdings. Mammon has never been ousted during a time when so many other archdevils have lost their positions, which is a testament to Bael’s skill on the battlefield.
For his accomplishments, as well as for the hue of his skin, Baal has been granted the title of Bronze General. His accolades notwithstanding, Bael has had a difficult time navigating the quagmire of infernal politics. His critics call him naive, though never to his face. His primary interest has always been leading soldiers in battle, so he finds it frustrating to have his ambitions of ascending to a higher rank constantly stymied by politically shrewd rivals.
Bael prefers to make servants out of his adversaries, and mortals bound to his service earn their wretched place by falling victim to Bael’s superior stratagems. Bael gladly spares the lives of those he defeats, but only if they pledge their souls and service to him. Although he is willing to corrupt almost any being in this way, he always destroys any demons he defeats.
Bael also welcomes mortals into his service if they can provide him with an advantage in his own politicking. He recruits savvy individuals and relies on them to represent his interests at Mammon’s court, which leaves Bael free to pursue his battle lust.
Despite his lack of interest in affairs outside battle, or perhaps because of it, Bael has gained a small following of cultists. Those who worship at his altar call him the King of Hell, and the most deluded believe that he is the lord of all devils. In arcane circles, certain writings, such as the dreaded Book of Fire, say that Bael revealed the invisibility spell to the world, though some scholars of magic hotly refute such claims. Bael is sometimes depicted as a toad, a cat, a male human, or some combination of these forms, though none of these images reflect his true appearance.</text>

			<name>Geryon's Lair</name>
			<text>Geryon has recently reclaimed his ancient fortress, Coldsteel, a sprawling complex that rises from the ice and snow at the center of Stygia. He roams the passages of this place, scattering the ice devils and minotaur slaves he took from Baphomet, raging against Asmodeus’s betrayal while spitting oaths of vengeance and hatching mad schemes to reclaim his standing from Levistus.
Lair Actions. On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), Geryon can take a lair action to cause one of the following effects; he can’t use the same effect two rounds in a row:
Geryon causes a blast of cold to burst from the ground at a point he can see within 120 feet of him. The cold fills a cube, 10 feet on each side, centered on that point. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 21 Constitution saving throw or take 28 (8d6) cold damage.
Geryon targets one creature he can see within 60 feet of him. The target must succeed on a DC 21 Wisdom saving throw or become restrained for 1 minute. The target can end the effect on itself if it deals any damage to one or more of its allies.
Geryon casts the banishment spell.
Regional Effects. The region containing Geryon’s lair is warped by his magic, creating one or more of the following effects:
Intelligent creatures within 1 mile of the lair frequently see shimmering portals leading to places they consider safe. Passing through a portal always deposits a traveler somewhere in Stygia.
Freezing strong winds howl around the area within 1 mile of the lair.
Howls and screams fill the air within 1 mile of the lair. Any creature that finishes a short or long rest in this area must succeed on a DC 21 Wisdom saving throw or derive no benefit from the rest.
If Geryon dies, these effects fade over the course of 1d10 days.</text>

			<name>Variant: Sound the Horn</name>
			<text>Geryon can have an action that allows him to summon enslaved minotaurs.
Sound the Horn (1/Day). Geryon blows his horn, which causes 5d4 minotaurs to appear in unoccupied spaces of his choice within 600 feet of him. The minotaurs roll initiative when they appear. They remain until they die or Geryon uses an action to dismiss any or all of them.</text>

			<name>Hutijin</name>
			<text>Politics in the Nine Hells are anything but predictable. Alliances form all the time, but most wind up unraveling due to treachery. Nevertheless, for all their backbiting and betrayal, the devils do occasionally display loyalty, offering unwavering service to their masters. One such example is Hutijin, a duke of Cania and loyal servant of Mephistopheles.
Across the Hells, Hutijin’s name fills lesser devils with fear and loathing, for this duke commands two companies of pit fiends, which make up Cania’s aristocracy. With such soldiers under his command, Hutijin can easily crush any rival who gets in his way, while also providing Mephistopheles with security against armies that might seek to contest his dominion. Hutijin has amassed enough power to challenge the lord of Cania, but he has never wavered in his support for his master — suggesting, perhaps, that Mephistopheles has some hold over him.
Outside the Nine Hells, Hutijin is a relatively obscure figure, known only to the most learned infernal scholars. He has no cults of his own, and his servants are few in number. The reason is simple: Hutijin hates mortals. When summoned from the Hells, he repays the instigator with a long and agonizing death.
Mephistopheles forbids Hutijin from making too many forays into the Material Plane, since the duke’s absence leaves him vulnerable to his rivals. Other archdevils know how much Hutijin despises mortals and have secretly disseminated the means to call him from the Nine Hells in the hope of distracting the archdevil long enough for them to assail Mephistopheles. Hutijin sends devils into the Material Plane to eradicate mention of his name and destroy those who have learned of him, but the summonings still occur. When called from his post, he negotiates as quickly as he can, usually closing a deal with little cost to the summoner. However, once the deal has been struck, Hutijin repays the interruption with death.</text>

			<name>Moloch</name>
			<text>Exiled from the Nine Hells, Moloch would do anything to reclaim his position. Long ago, Moloch earned his place among the other archdevils through the glory he won driving demons out of the Nine Hells. Asmodeus rewarded him by elevating Moloch to the rulership of Malbolge.
For eons, Moloch ruled his domain, vying against the other archdevils as he sought still greater power. This animosity worked in Asmodeus’s favor, since Asmodeus knew that Moloch’s scheming helped keep the other archdevils in check. The arrangement began to unravel, however, when Moloch took the night hag named Malagard for his advisor. Her words were poison, and gradually she convinced Moloch to direct his efforts to topple Asmodeus. Although the conspiracy nearly succeeded, it was thwarted. Moloch was stripped of his station and sentenced to death — and only the timely use of a planar portal allowed him to escape.

Moloch wasted no time in preparing for his return. He amassed an army of devils and monsters and left them to make final preparations for invading the Nine Hells, while he ventured to a distant Material Plane in the hope of finding an artifact that would ensure his success. While there, he became trapped, leaving his armies at the mercy of his enemies. In short order they were destroyed.
Now, Moloch has been rendered nearly powerless after his last failure. He endlessly schemes of ways to return to his former status, but every time he enters the Nine Hells, he is demoted to an imp and can’t regain his normal powers until he leaves. Thus, he lives a split existence, sometimes scheming in Malbolge or other layers of the Hells and at other times wandering the planes searching for magical might or secrets that might help him win back his title.
Rumors suggest that he can often be found in Sigil, where he bargains with yugoloths to build yet another army with which he might invade Malbolge and wrest the throne from Glasya. Bereft as he is, he has little to offer in exchange, so he might bargain with mortals to gain their aid in acquiring coin, jewels, and other riches in return for knowledge about the Nine Hells and the other planes.
Most of Moloch’s cultists have switched allegiance to one of the other archdevils, but idols constructed to honor him still stand in deep dungeons, their jeweled eyes and the remnants of power they hold drawing monstrous worshipers and unwise adventurers into places where his foul influence remains.</text>

			<name>Archdevils</name>
			<text>At the top of the hierarchy of the Nine Hells stand the archdevils, a vicious and backbiting group made up of the Hells’ elite devils. They include the various lords, the nobles who owe them fealty, and some exiles and outcasts who have fallen out of favor. Favor in the Nine Hells shifts like the wind, and the fortunes of the great and mighty rise and fall at the whims of their betters. Many dread names are included in the rolls of the archdevils; the few described here are among those that adventurers are most likely to encounter.
Wish Fulfillment. All devils seek control over mortal souls, so they offer enticements to tempt mortals into making unwise bargains. Archdevils, possessing the true power of the Nine Hells, can fulfill nearly any desire (within the limits of a wish spell) requested by the mortals they bind to their infernal contracts. Archdevils always fulfill the letter of the wish, rewarding desperate mortals with a twisted interpretation of their desires. In exchange for this gift, the devil expects and receives total power over a soul and usually claims it upon the mortal’s death. An archdevil can’t fulfill its own wish.</text>

		<legendary>
			<name>Titivilus</name>
			<text>The gloomy Lord of the Second, Dispater, rules from his iron palace, seeming to hide surrounded by its labyrinthine corridors, iron walls, diabolical traps, and monstrous servants. So intense is his paranoia that he almost never travels farther than the sprawling city that lies outside his magnificent palace. Dispater knows he has enemies on all sides — enemies who would do to him what has been done to the likes of Geryon, Moloch, and so many others.
Dispater is correct to fear, but the true threat comes not from without. The lord’s great error was allowing himself to be seduced by Titivilus, who beguiled his way into being the primary advisor in Dispater’s household.
Although he is inferior in physical strength and power when compared to other archdevils, Titivilus compensates with cunning. A shrewd and calculating politician, he has clawed his way up through the ranks to become the second-most powerful fiend in Dis, entirely by saying just the right thing at the right time to get what he wanted. Charming and pleasant, he is a master at negotiation, able to twist words in such a way as to leave his victims confused and believing they have found a friend in Titivilus. Through these skills, Titivilus has manipulated everyone along his path to power, either to win them over to his cause or to remove them as a threat.
Since gaining his position, Titivilus has convinced Dispater that countless plots are being hatched against him and that Asmodeus himself seeks to remove Dispater from power. In response, Dispater has withdrawn to his palace and left day-to-day decisions to Titivilus, while also authorizing him to answer and negotiate bargains with mortals who attempt to summon Dispater. Titivilus now represents his master and speaks with his voice, a turn of events that leads some to whisper that either Titivilus is Dispater in disguise, or that Titivilus has removed the archduke and replaced him altogether.
Titivilus recognizes the inherent precariousness of his position. After all, Dispater’s acceptance of his plans and his advice can last only so long before some other plotter steps in and reveals the truth. For insurance, Titi­vilus has begun recruiting outsiders to deal with problem devils, to insulate himself against criticism, and, above all, to create complications that he can solve so as to reinforce his value in the eyes of his master. Titi­vilus finds adventurers well suited to the tasks he needs performed and recruits them directly or through intermediaries, expending them later as his plans require.</text>

			<name>Zariel</name>
			<text>Zariel rules Avernus, the first layer of the Nine Hells. Once a mighty angel charged with watching the tides of the Blood War, she succumbed to the plane’s corrupting influence and fell from grace. She recently reclaimed her position as archdevil of Avernus after the cautious Bel proved inadequate at marshaling his forces to launch offensives against the encroaching demons. Now Bel advises her and helps her manage the war, though many whisper that her true agenda is vengeance against Asmodeus, and her true plan is to drive him from the Nine Hells.
All who enter and exit the Nine Hells must pass through Avernus, so the infernal armies muster on this layer. Here, the amnizus guard the citadels overlooking the River Styx, much of the fighting of the Blood War takes place, and devils gather to invade the Abyss. Anyone hoping to reach the lower layers must first contend with the darkness of this layer and the myriad threats it houses. Zariel manages it all and has the ultimate say over who comes and goes.
Given her role in the Blood War, Zariel is keenly interested in collecting souls from the greatest warriors on the Material Plane and securing their loyalty. She bargains hard, and mortals end up worse for dealing with her, because she holds all the cards. A bargain with Zariel is eternal; there is little hope of wriggling out of it. However, she does expect the best from her servants, and so she allows her mortal followers to live out their lives, ever honing their talents, so she can put them to the best use when she finally calls in their debts. As a result, Zariel’s servants are universally effective, disciplined, and dangerous.
Zariel’s Lair
Zariel makes her lair in a basalt citadel that rises up in Avernus. From nearly a mile away, one can hear the screams and moans coming from the burned victims chained to the stronghold’s wall, the dying remains of those who failed to impress the archdevil. The stronghold, covering five square miles, is surrounded by walls reinforced with high turrets. Devils of all kinds crawl over the structure, ensuring that no intruders breach their defenses.
Lair Actions. On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), Zariel can take a lair action to cause one of the following effects; she can’t use the same effect two rounds in a row:
Zariel casts major image four times at its lowest level, targeting different areas with the spell. Zariel prefers to create images of intruders’ loved ones being burned alive. Zariel doesn’t need to concentrate on the spells, which end on initiative count 20 of the next round. Each creature that can see these illusions must succeed on a DC 26 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of the illusion for 1 minute. A frightened creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
Zariel casts her innate fireball spell.
Regional Effects. The region containing Zariel’s lair is warped by her magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:
The area within 9 miles of the lair is filled with screaming voices and the stench of burning meat.
Once every 60 feet within 1 mile of the lair, 10-foot-high gouts of flame rise from the ground. Any creature or object that touches the flame takes 7 (2d6) fire damage, though it can take this damage no more than once per round.
The area within 2 miles, but no closer than 500 feet, of the lair is filled with smoke, which causes the area to be heavily obscured. The smoke can’t be cleared away.
If Zariel dies, these effects fade over the course of 1d10 days.</text>

			<name>Eidolon</name>
			<text>The gods have many methods for protecting sites they deem holy. One servant they rely on often to do so is the eidolon, a ghostly spirit bound by a sacred oath to safeguard a place of import to the divine. Forged from the souls of those who had proven their unwavering devotion, eidolons stalk temples and vaults, places where miracles have been witnessed and relics enshrined, to ensure that no enemy can gain a foothold against the gods’ cause through defilement or violence within these sites. If an enemy with such intent sets foot inside a warded location, the eidolon plunges into a graven vessel, a statue specially prepared to house the souls of these protectors. The eidolon then animates the effigy and uses the borrowed body to drive out the intruders bent on plundering the relics it is charged with guarding.
Sacred Guardians. Creating an eidolon requires a spirit of fanatical devotion — that of an individual who, in life, served with unwavering faithfulness. Upon death, a god might reward such a follower with everlasting service in the protection of a holy site. An eidolon has no purpose beyond guarding the place it was assigned to and never leaves.
Animated Statues. An eidolon has few methods for protecting itself beyond its ability to awaken its sacred vessels. When a foe enters, the eidolon leaps into action by merging its body with one of several statues at the site. After doing so, the eidolon controls the construct as if it was its own body and uses its fists to drive back intruders, smashing and crushing anything it can reach.
Undead Nature. An eidolon doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.</text>

Undead Nature. An eidolon doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.</text>

			<name>Eladrin</name>
			<text>Eladrin dwell in the verdant splendor of the Feywild. They are related to the elves found on the Material Plane, and resemble them in both their love of beauty and the value they place on personal freedom. But where other elves can temper their wild impulses, eladrin are creatures ruled by emotion — and because of their unique magical nature, they undergo physical changes to match their changes in temperament.
The eladrin have spent centuries in the Feywild, and most of them have become fey creatures as a result. Some of them are still humanoid, similar in that respect to their other elven kin. The eladrin presented here are of the fey variety.
Creatures of Passion. The magic flowing through eladrin responds to their emotional state by transforming them into different seasonal aspects, with behaviors and capabilities that change with their forms. Some eladrin might remain in a particular aspect for years, while others run through the emotional spectrum each week.
Lovers of Beauty. Regardless of the aspect they express, eladrin love beauty and surround themselves with lovely things. Eladrin try to possess any objects they find striking. They might seek to own a painting, a statue, or a glittering jewel. When they encounter people of comely form or luminous spirit, they use their magic to delight those folk or, in the case of evil eladrin, to abduct them.
CHANGEABLE NATURE
Whenever one of the eladrin presented here finishes a long rest, it can associate itself with a different season, provided it isn’t incapacitated. When the eladrin makes this change, it uses the stat block of the new season, rather than its old stat block. Any damage the eladrin sustained in its original form applies to the new form, as do any conditions or other ongoing effects affecting it.
Eladrin often enter the autumn season when they are overcome by feelings of goodwill. In this aspect, they defuse conflicts and alleviate suffering by using their magic to heal, to cure, and to relieve any ailment that might afflict the people who come to them for aid. They tolerate no violence in their presence and move quickly to settle disputes, to ensure that peace continues to reign.</text>

			<name>Elder Elementals</name>
			<text>On their native planes, elementals sweep across the weird and tempestuous landscape. Some possess greater power, gained by feeding on their lesser kin and adding the essence of creatures they have devoured to their own until they become something extraordinary. When summoned, these elder elementals manifest as beings of apocalyptic capability, entities whose mere existence promises destruction.
Deadly When Summoned. The methods for summoning elder elementals remain hidden in forbidden tomes or inscribed on the walls of lost temples raised to honor the Elder Elemental Eye. Only casters of superlative skill have even the faintest chance of calling forth one of these monsters, and the spellcaster is often destroyed by the effort. Thus, only the most unhinged and nihilistic members of Elemental Evil cults attempt such a summoning, in the hope of hastening the world toward some cataclysmic end.
Elemental Nature. An elder elemental doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.
Leviathan
A towering wall of water that drags ships down to the ocean’s depths and washes away coastal settlements — that phenomenon typifies the destruction a leviathan can unleash on the world. When called forth, a leviathan arises from a large body of water to form an immense serpent-shaped creature.</text>

			<text>On their native planes, elementals sweep across the weird and tempestuous landscape. Some possess greater power, gained by feeding on their lesser kin and adding the essence of creatures they have devoured to their own until they become something extraordinary. When summoned, these elder elementals manifest as beings of apocalyptic capability, entities whose mere existence promises destruction.
Deadly When Summoned. The methods for summoning elder elementals remain hidden in forbidden tomes or inscribed on the walls of lost temples raised to honor the Elder Elemental Eye. Only casters of superlative skill have even the faintest chance of calling forth one of these monsters, and the spellcaster is often destroyed by the effort. Thus, only the most unhinged and nihilistic members of Elemental Evil cults attempt such a summoning, in the hope of hastening the world toward some cataclysmic end.
Elemental Nature. An elder elemental doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.
Phoenix
Releasing a phoenix from the Inner Planes creates an explosion of fire that spreads across the sky. An enormous fiery bird forms in the center of the flames and smoke — an elder elemental possessed by a need to burn everything to ash. The phoenix rarely stays in one place for long as it strives to transform the world into an inferno.</text>

Elder Tempest
Terrifying storms manifest in the body of the elder tempest. A being carved from clouds, wind, rain, and lightning, the elder tempest assumes the shape of a serpent that slithers through the sky.

			<name>Earth-Shaking Movement</name>
			<text>As a bonus action after moving at least 10 feet on the ground, the zaratan can send a shock wave through the ground in a 120-foot-radius circle centered on itself. That area becomes difficult terrain for 1 minute. Each creature on the ground that is concentrating must succeed on a DC 25 Constitution saving throw or the creature’s concentration is broken.
The shock wave deals 100 thunder damage to all structures in contact with the ground in the area. If a creature is near a structure that collapses, the creature might be buried; a creature within half the distance of the structure’s height must make a DC 25 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 17 (5d6) bludgeoning damage, is knocked prone, and is trapped in the rubble. A trapped creature is restrained, requiring a successful DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check as an action to escape. Another creature within 5 feet of the buried creature can use its action to clear rubble and grant advantage on the check. If three creatures use their actions in this way, the check is an automatic success. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and doesn’t fall prone or become trapped.</text>

Zaratan
When a zaratan is summoned from the Elemental Plane of Earth, the ground rises up to take the shape of what looks like a hulking, armored reptile, its shell composed of the landscape from which it arose. The zaratan plods across the land, each step sending shock waves through the ground severe enough to unsettle structures. Dim-witted, the zaratan lurches onward, expressing its rage through its trumpeting calls and the occasional boulder or blast of debris it spews from its cavernous maw. If seriously injured, the zaratan slowly retracts its appendages to gain shelter beneath its impervious shell, biding its time until it recovers and can resume its march.</text>

Military Organization. Every aspect of giff society is organized along military lines. From birth until death, every giff has a military rank. It must follow orders from those of superior rank, and it can give orders to those of lower rank. Promotions don’t depend on age but are granted by a superior as a reward for valor. Giff are devoted to their children, even as most of their education is geared toward fighting and war.
Mercenaries Extraordinaire. Giff are in high demand as warriors for hire, but they insist on serving in units composed entirely of giff; a giff hiring itself out individually is unheard of. Giff refuse to fight other giff, and will never agree to a contract unless it stipulates that they can sit out a battle rather than wage war against their kin. A giff prizes the reputation of its unit above its own life. Life is fleeting, but the regiment endures for generations or even centuries.
A Whiff of Gunpowder. Muskets and grenades are the favorite weapons of every giff. The bigger the boom, the brighter the flash, and the thicker the smoke it produces, the more giff love a weapon. Their skill with gunpowder is another reason for their popularity as mercenaries. Giff revel in the challenge of building a bomb big enough to level a fortification. They gladly accept payment in kegs of gunpowder in preference to gold, gems, or other currency.
No Honor in Magic. Some giff become wizards, clerics, and other kinds of spellcasters, but they’re so infrequent that most giff mercenary units have no magical capability. Typical giff are as smart as the average human, but their focus on military training to the exclusion of all other areas of study can make them seem dull-witted to those who have more varied interests.</text>

			<name>Gunpowder by the Keg</name>
			<text>Aside from their personal gunpowder weapons, giff ships and mercenary companies carry spare gunpowder in kegs. In an emergency, or any time a large explosion is needed, a whole keg can be detonated. A giff lights the fuse on the keg and can then throw the keg up to 15 feet as part of the same action. The keg explodes at the start of the giff’s next turn. Each creature within 20 feet of the exploding keg must make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 24 (7d6) fire damage and is knocked prone. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn’t knocked prone.
Every other keg of gunpowder within 20 feet of an exploding keg has a 50 percent chance of also exploding. Check each keg only once per turn, no matter how many other kegs explode around it.</text>

		<legendary>
			<name>Githzerai Anarch</name>
			<text>The most powerful of the githzerai, anarchs lead communities and maintain the adamantine citadels that serve as strong points in planes beyond Limbo. They have formidable psionic capabilities, able to manipulate the unformed substance of their adopted plane with a thought. These rare githzerai are sages and mystics, and their word is law.
An Anarch’s Lair
In Limbo, githzerai anarchs create islands of tranquility in the otherwise turbulent plane. By directing its psionic power, an anarch can give form to formless substance, creating mountains, lakes, and structures of any composition to serve as a foundation for a githzerai community.
Lair Actions. An anarch can use lair actions. On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the anarch can take a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the anarch can’t use the same effect two rounds in a row:
The anarch casts the lightning bolt spell (at 5th level), but the anarch can change the damage type from lightning to cold, fire, psychic, radiant, or thunder. If the spell deals damage other than fire or lightning, it doesn’t ignite flammable objects.
The anarch casts the creation spell (as a 9th-level spell) using the unformed substance of Limbo instead of shadow material. If used in Limbo, the object remains until the anarch’s concentration is broken, regardless of its composition. If the anarch moves more than 120 feet from the object, its concentration breaks.
The anarch can magically move an object it can see within 150 feet of it by making a Wisdom check with advantage. The DC depends on the object’s size: DC 5 for Tiny, DC 10 for Small, DC 15 for Medium, DC 20 for Large, and DC 25 for Huge or larger.
Regional Effects. The region containing an anarch’s lair is warped by its presence, which creates one or more of the following effects:
In Limbo, the anarch can spend 10 minutes stabilizing a 5-mile area centered on it, causing the unformed substance to take whatever inanimate form the anarch chooses. During that process, the anarch determines the shape and composition of the forms created.
The anarch stabilizes any object created in Limbo and brought to the Material Plane for as long as the anarch remains within 1 mile of it (no action required).
If the anarch dies, these effects end after 1d6 rounds. All formed substance becomes a chaotic churn of energy and matter, unraveling into unformed substance that dissipates 1d6 rounds later.</text>

			<name>Gray Render</name>
			<text>A curious impulse drives the gray render. Despite its hulking form and terrible appetite, it wants most of all to bond with an intelligent creature and, once bonded, give its life to protect that creature. Great strength and a savage nature enable gray renders to be fierce guardians, but they lack even a shred of cunning.
A Spreading Plague. Gray renders reproduce by forming nodules on their bodies that, upon reaching maturity, break off to begin life as young gray renders. These monstrosities feel no obligation to their young, and they have no inclination to gather with others of their kind.
Chaotic Allies. As a side effect of its breeding, each gray render has an overpowering need to bond with an intelligent creature. When it encounters a suitable master, the render sings to it — a weird, warbling cry accompanied by scratching at the earth and a show of deference. Once it forms the bond, the render serves its master in all things.
Although this bond can be a great benefit, renders are inherently chaotic. In a battle, a render fights with all the savagery it can muster and never willingly harms its master, but outside battle, a gray render might present considerable difficulty for its master’s associates. It might follow its master even after being told to stay put, destroy its master’s house, burrow holes in the side of a ship, kill horses, attack when it feels jealous, and more. A gray render might be a boon companion, but it is always an unpredictable one.
The Gray Render Quirks table presents possible quirks for gray renders that can be generated randomly or selected as desired.</text>

			<text>The howler emits a keening howl in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area that isn’t deafened must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened until the end of the howler’s next turn. While a creature is frightened in this way, its speed is halved, and it is incapacitated. A target that successfully saves is immune to the Mind-Breaking Howl of all howlers for the next 24 hours.</text>

			<name>Howler</name>
			<text>A far-off wail precedes the sight of a howler. Even at a distance, one’s mind cringes at the sound and fills with horror at the realization that the noise is drawing closer. When howlers go on the prowl, courage isn’t enough to stand up against them, and even one’s sanity is at risk.
Prowlers from Pandemonium. These nightmare creatures, native to Pandemonium, can also be found on most of the Lower Planes, because of the many fiends that capture them and train them as war hounds. Howlers can be domesticated, after a fashion, but they respond only to brutal training during which they are forced to recognize the trainer as the pack’s undisputed leader. A trained pack then follows its leader without hesitation. Howler packs course over the battlefields of the Blood War and also serve evil mortals who have the power and the savagery to command their loyalty.
Brutal Hunters. Howlers rely on speed, numbers, and their mind-numbing howl to corner prey before they tear it apart. The howl floods the minds of its victims, making complex thought impossible. They can do little more than stare in horror and stumble around the battlefield in a search for safety. Any task more demanding than that is beyond their capability. Fiends especially prize howlers for this reason, because for a few crucial moments in a battle, their howls can neutralize an enemy’s ability to use spells and other powers.</text>

			<text>Kruthiks are chitin-covered reptiles that hunt in packs and nest in sprawling subterranean warrens. They are attracted t o sources of heat, such as dwarven forges and pools of molten lava, and carve out lairs as close to such locations as possible. As they burrow through the earth, they leave behind tunnels — evidence that is often the first clue to the nearby presence of a kruthik hive. Kruthiks also make use of preexisting underground chambers, incorporating them into their lairs when they can.
Kruthiks communicate with one another through a series of hisses and chittering noises. These sounds can often be heard in advance of a kruthik attack. Whenever their lair is invaded, kruthik guards send out an alarm by rapidly tapping the stone floor with their sharp legs.</text>

			<name>Marut</name>
			<text>The nigh-unstoppable inevitables serve a singular purpose: they enforce contracts forged in the Hall of Concordance in the city of Sigil. Primus, the leader of the modrons, created maruts and other inevitables to bring order to dealings between planar folk. Many creatures, including yugoloths, will enter into a contract with inevitables if asked.
Cosmic Enforcers. The Hall of Concordance is an embassy of pure law in Sigil, the City of Doors. In the hall, two parties who agree to mutual terms — and who pay the requisite gold to the Kolyarut, a mechanical engine of absolute jurisprudence — can have their contract chiseled onto a sheet of gold that is placed in the chest of a marut. From that moment until the contract is fulfilled, the marut is bound to enforce its terms and to punish any party who breaks them. A marut resorts to lethal force only when a contract calls for it, when the contract is fully broken, or when the marut is attacked.
Word Is Law. Inevitables care nothing for the spirit of an agreement, only the letter. A marut enforces what is written, not what was meant by or supposed to be understood from the writing. The Kolyarut rejects contracts that contain vague, contradictory, or unenforceable terms. Beyond that, it doesn’t care whether both parties understand what they’re agreeing to. A small army of solicitors waits outside the Hall of Concordance, eager to sell their expertise in the crafting or vetting of contracts.
Constructed Nature. A marut doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.</text>

			<text>In places where the Shadowfell washes against the shores of the Material Plane dwell meazels, hateful hermits who left behind their old lives to contemplate their misery in shadow. Now evil burns in their hearts, and they resent any intrusion into their suffering.
Hateful Hermit. Meazels are all that remain of people who fled into the Shadowfell to escape their mortal existence. There the darkness transformed them, and their bitterness made them twisted and cruel. Now, they loiter near Shadowfell crossings to waylay travelers who venture too close to their lairs.
Divide and Conquer. The stain of darkness responsible for the existence of meazels imparts to them magical powers that allow them to move through shadows with ease. Merely stepping into one pool of darkness allows a meazel to move to another one. They use this talent to ambush creatures, snatching them around the throat with their strangling cords and then stepping away. Meazels also use this ability to ferry their victims to isolated spots and then leave the hapless souls to the designs of whatever horrors lurk there.
Creatures that are drawn through the shadows by meazels are cursed by the meazels’ baleful magic. The curse acts as a beacon; sorrowsworn, undead, and other terrors sense where they are located and descend on the stranded victims to tear them apart.</text>

			<name>Nagpa</name>
			<text>Long ago, the Raven Queen cursed a cabal of thirteen powerful wizards for meddling in a ritual that would have helped avert a war between the gods. She stripped them of their beauty, turning them into scabrous, birdlike monstrosities. The nagpas now plot as they ever did, but they now strive to bring about terrible, world-shaking calamities so they can pry secrets and power from the wreckage their conspiracies create.
The nagpas fear the Raven Queen and do their best to avoid her and her agents. When it’s impossible to do so, they become cringing, fawning things, eager to please and thereby escape the cold gaze of the being who brought them so low. All of the original thirteen remain alive, thanks to their cunning and their willingness to do whatever is necessary to survive.
Looters of Civilization. The curse the Raven Queen placed on the nagpas restricts the ways in which they can acquire new lore and magical power, barring them from any source except for the ruins left behind from fallen civilizations and great calamities. For this reason, nagpas turn their efforts to bringing about such ends, so they can loot the libraries, plunder the vaults, and gather up secrets of arcane lore from the wreckage.
Puppet Masters. Nagpas work in the shadows, manipulating events to bring about ruin. As accomplished magic-users, they can bring to bear an array of spells to make agents of other creatures, influencing their decisions in subtle ways and pulling on strings to make them into unwitting accomplices in their own destruction. Nagpas show great patience in their plots and have several schemes working simultaneously, each at different stages of completion, so if one plan goes awry, they can shift their focus to another. Typically, nagpas only show their handiwork and emerge from the shadows when they can deliver a finishing blow and then revel in the grand devastation their plotting brought about.</text>

			<name>Nightwalker</name>
			<text>The Negative Plane is a place of darkness and death, anathema to all living things. Yet there are those who would tap into its fell power, to use its energy for sinister ends. Most often, when such individuals approach the midnight realm, they find they are unequal to the task. Those not destroyed outright are sometimes drawn inside the plane and replaced by nightwalkers, terrifying undead creatures that devour all life they encounter.
Mighty Spawn. One can reach the Negative Plane from the Shadowfell, much in the same way that it is possible to step from the Material Plane into the Shadowfell in a place where the barrier between the planes is thin.
Stepping into the Negative Plane is tantamount to suicide, since the plane sucks the life and soul from such audacious creatures and annihilates them at once. Those few who survive the effort do so by sheer luck or by harnessing some rare form of magic that protects them against the hostile atmosphere. They soon discover, however, that they can’t leave as easily as they arrived. For each creature that enters the plane, a nightwalker is released to take its place. In order for a trapped creature to escape, the released nightwalker must be lured back to the Negative Plane by offerings of life for it to devour. If the nightwalker is destroyed, the trapped creature has no hope of escape.
Beings of Anti-Life. One can discern the nature of creatures trapped in the Negative Plane from the sites that nightwalkers frequent. Generally, a nightwalker on the Material Plane is attracted to elements of the world associated with the creature responsible for its creation. Such interest doesn’t indicate a willingness to engage with the world; nightwalkers exist to make life extinct and never to serve living things.
Undead Nature. A nightwalker doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.</text>

Oblex Spawn
An oblex devours memories not only to sustain its existence, but also to spawn new oblexes. Each time it fully drains the memories of a victim, it gains the creature’s personality — now twisted by the oblex’s foul nature. The more memories an oblex steals, the larger it becomes, until it must shed a personality it has absorbed or else go insane. This act spawns a new oblex.</text>

Adult and Elder Oblexes
Newly formed oblexes lack the capabilities of their older kin. They seek only to feed on memories and grow until they can impersonate their victims.
Older oblexes, called adults and elders, have eaten so many memories that they can form duplicates of the creatures they have devoured from the substance of their bodies, sending them off to lure prey into their clutches, while remaining tethered to the slime by long tendrils of goo. These duplicated creatures are indistinguishable from their victims except for a faint sulfurous smell. Oblexes use these duplicates to lure prey into danger or to infiltrate settlements so they can feed on superior victims.</text>

			<name>Retriever</name>
			<text>The retriever is a potent, spider-like construct conceived and built by the drow for one original purpose — to prowl the Abyss and capture demons for the drow to enslave or use in their rituals. The automatons proved so effective and so fearsome that they now perform many different missions.
Demon-Infused. Although each retriever is a metal-and-magic construct, it houses the imprisoned spirit of a bebilith. Most of the demon’s intellect has been distilled away, leaving only its cruelty and cunning.
Lethal Collectors. Though they were created to operate only in the Abyss, retrievers are sometimes dispatched when a powerful drow needs some creature or object captured and brought back alive and intact. Only under the rarest of circumstances is a retriever handed over or sold to a non-drow, since the dark elves don’t want to take the chance that the construct will be turned against them.</text>

			<name>Frost Salamander</name>
			<text>Frost salamanders are natives of the Plane of Ice, also called the Frostfell, which rests between the Plane of Air and the Plane of Water. Frost salamanders especially like to hunt warm-blooded creatures. They sometimes travel to frigid climes on the Material Plane by wandering through planar gates.
Devourers of Heat. The frost salamanders’ aggression appetite for any heat source leads them to attack settlements they come across. They might mistake the fire of a forge or a campfire for a large, tasty meal, drawing them to attack expeditions and settlements that other predators would avoid. Azers sometimes venture into the Frostfell, where they use large fires to lure frost salamanders into traps to kill them and collect their hides and fangs for use in crafting weapons and armor.
False Refuge. Although frost salamanders can burrow their way through loose soil, they prefer to dig into the ice. They roll around in piles of broken chunks of ice, allowing it to scratch their backs as they grind it down. This habit leads them to create extensive networks of ice caves, becoming ever larger as they claw fresh chunks of ice from the walls of their lairs.
A frost salamander that dwells in a lair for a while carves out enough space to allow a small army to camp within. Inexperienced travelers who come across these caves see them as a welcome shelter, though they are anything but. Frost salamanders greedily devour any prey foolhardy enough to try sleeping in their lairs.
On rare occasions, frost giants capture and tame these creatures, using them to burrow into the ice to help create outposts and fortresses.</text>

They are so devoid of identity that they have become permanently invisible. Only children can see a skulk without the help of a mirror or a special candle. On the rare occasions when a skulk is visible, it appears as a drab, featureless, hairless humanoid.
Summoned Servants. A skulk can be summoned from the Shadowfell by performing a ritual. If the creature is given a portion of the summoner’s identity, the skulk is bound to obey the summoner’s commands for 30 days. If a skulk is visible, an astute observer might deduce who summoned it, because a skulk assumes a vague likeness of its master.
Cruel and chaotic, skulks carry out their orders in the most violent manner possible. A summoned skulk can’t return to the Shadowfell until it dies, so it has every motivation to throw itself into creating bloodshed and mayhem.
Hollow Lives. After killing a person in the material world, a skulk sometimes takes up a silent imitation of that person’s life. In extreme cases, skulks have invaded villages, killed all the occupants, and turned the places into seeming ghost towns, where flavorless food is prepared daily, colorless clothes are hung up to dry, and livestock is shifted from pen to pen until it starves.</text>

			<text>The skull lords have claimed vast regions of the Shadowfell as their dominion. From these blighted lands, they wage war against their rivals, commanding hordes of undead in a bid to establish dominance. Yet skull lords always prove to be their own worst enemies; as a combined being born from three hateful individuals, they constantly plot against themselves.
Creatures of Betrayal. Infighting and treachery brought the skull lords into existence. The first of them appeared in the aftermath of Vecna’s bid to conquer the world of Greyhawk, after the vampire Kas betrayed Vecna and took his eye and hand. In the confusion resulting from this turn of events, Vecna’s warlords turned against each other, and the dark one’s plans were dashed. In a rage, Vecna gathered up his generals and captains and bound them in groups of three, fusing them into undead abominations cursed to fight among themselves for all time. Since the first skull lords were exiled into shadow, others have joined them, typically after being created from other leaders who betrayed their masters.
Undead Nature. A skull lord doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.</text>

			<name>Star Spawn</name>
			<text>The Material Plane represents only one small part of the multiverse. Beyond the best-known planes of existence lie realms that are lethal to mortal life. Some are so hostile that even a moment’s contact with such a place is enough to plunge a mortal mind into madness. Yet beings do exist that are native to these realms: beings that are eternally hungering, searching, warring, sometimes dreaming. These Elder Evils are far older than most of the mortal races and always horrific to humanoid minds.
However much they might desire to enter and dominate the Material Plane, the Elder Evils are unable or unwilling to leave their realms. Some are imprisoned in their dimensions by external forces, some are inextricably bound to their home realities, and others simply can’t find any way out.
Heralds of Doom. The creatures known as star spawn are the heralds, servants, foot soldiers, and lieutenants of the Elder Evils, capable of taking on forms that can journey to the Material Plane. They arrive most often in the wake of a comet — or perhaps such a phenomenon merely signals that star spawn are in the vicinity and available for communication. When the signs are right, warlocks and cultists hasten to gather together, read aloud their blasphemous texts, and conduct the mind-searing rituals that guide the blazing star spawn into the world.</text>
		</legendary>

			<name>Star Spawn Grue</name>
			<text>Fanged and lipless, the ever-grinning, madly staring grue lopes about on spindly legs and long arms. Bristles and spines project from odd patches of its pallid skin, and it’s long fingers end in broken and dirty nails. Grues are the weakest of the star spawn. A host of writhing, scrambling grues typically accompanies more powerful star spawn. Their constant chittering and shrieking produces discordant psychic energy that disrupts thought patterns in other creatures. Intelligent creatures experience flashing colors, hallucinations, disorientation, and waves of hopelessness when they find themselves near a group of star spawn grues.</text>

			<name>Elder Evils</name>
			<text>Exactly who or what the Elder Evils are remains in dispute among the rare sources of knowledge about them. Few creatures in the multiverse have any awareness of these beings, and no one can claim to know them all.
Some Elder Evils are called gods, primordials, or fiends. Yet some scholars versed in esoteric mysteries insist they are none of these, but in fact are beings set apart from what mortals consider reality. Some Elder Evils are alleged to be creatures of the Far Realm, while others are thought to be trapped in a particular plane or world, or held in check somehow by wandering stars, imprisoned in the vastness of the night sky.
The names given to these terrible entities include such strange descriptions as Ityak-Ortheel the Elf-Eater, Dendar the Night Serpent, Borem of the Lake of Boiling Mud, Kezef the Chaos Hound, Zargon the Returner, Camnod the Unseen, Holashner the Hunger Below, Piscaethces the Blood Queen, Shothotugg the Eater of Worlds, Y’chak the Violet Flame, Bolothamogg Who Watches from Beyond the Stars, Hargut of the Gray Pestilence, Haask the Voice of Hargut, Ragnorra the Mother of Monsters, the Hulks of Zoretha, Kyuss the Worm That Walks, Tharizdun the Elder Elemental Eye, Atropus the World Born Dead, Pandorym the Utter Annihilation, Haemnathuun the Blood Lord, Maram of the Great Spear, Tyranthraxus the Flamed One, the unnamed Queen of Chaos, and Father Llymic, the Alien Thought Given Flesh.
The extent to which these beings have power beyond their native environments varies, as do notions of their relative strength. But they are all forces of corruption and evil. Nothing good can come from their influence. No bargain made with them ends in anything other than madness, plague, death, or worse.</text>

		<legendary>
			<name>Elder Evil Blessings</name>
			<text>Through generations of study and grim practice, the disciples of certain Elder Evils have mastered the ability to bestow supernatural gifts on minions they select for the privilege. Any creature that serves a cult of Elder Evil, including a star spawn, can be given one of these rewards — usually as compensation for faithful service, but sometimes as a chance for a creature that breached the cult’s laws to redeem itself. The following powers are unique to specific cults, and typically a creature has no more than one of them.
Cult of Borem of the Lake of Boiling Mud
Borem’s Embrace (1/Day). The cultist touches one creature within 5 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or be coated in sticky, steaming mud. While it is coated in this way, the target’s speed is halved, it can’t use reactions, and it takes 10 (3d6) fire damage at the start of each of its turns. The effect lasts for 1 minute, until the cultist is incapacitated or dies, or until the target is immersed in water.
Cult of Atropus the World Born Dead
Gaze of Corruption (Recharge 6). The cultist targets one creature it can see within 30 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 16 (3d10) necrotic damage and be poisoned for 1 minute. The poisoned target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
Cult of Haask the Voice of Hargut
Haask’s Presence (1/Day). The cultist transforms into a Tiny, leech-like being and teleports onto the shoulder of a humanoid that it can see within 30 feet of it. The targeted humanoid must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or be charmed by the cultist. While the target is charmed, the cultist has control of it on the target’s next turn. At the end of that turn, the cultist teleports to an unoccupied space it can see within 30 feet of it and returns to its normal form. The cultist can’t be targeted directly by any attack or other effect while it’s in the slug-like form, but it is subject to areas of effect as normal.
Cult of Tyranthraxus the Flamed One
Radiant Flames (1/Day). Multihued flame surrounds the cultist for 1 minute, until the cultist is incapacitated or dies, or until the cultist extinguishes the flame (no action required). While inflamed, the cultist has telepathy with a range of 30 feet, and it can teleport as a bonus action up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space it can see. In addition, every creature that starts its turn within 5 feet of the cultist must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 16 (3d10) radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
Cult of Tharizdun the Chained God
Tharizdun’s Spark (Recharge 6). As a bonus action, the cultist touches a simple or martial weapon or a natural weapon, if it has one. The next creature hit by the touched weapon must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or experience short-term madness for 10 minutes. Consult the Short-Term Madness table (see “Madness Effects” in chapter 8 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide) to determine the form of the madness. The affected creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each minute, ending the effect on itself on a success.</text>

Some Elder Evils are alleged to be creatures of the Far Realm, while others are thought to be trapped in a particular plane or world, or held in check somehow by wandering stars, imprisoned in the vastness of the night sky.
The names given to these terrible entities include such strange descriptions as Ityak-Ortheel the Elf-Eater, Dendar the Night Serpent, Borem of the Lake of Boiling Mud, Kezef the Chaos Hound, Zargon the Returner, Camnod the Unseen, Holashner the Hunger Below, Piscaethces the Blood Queen, Shothotugg the Eater of Worlds, Y’chak the Violet Flame, Bolothamogg Who Watches from Beyond the Stars, Hargut of the Gray Pestilence, Haask the Voice of Hargut, Ragnorra the Mother of Monsters, the Hulks of Zoretha, Kyuss the Worm That Walks, Tharizdun the Elder Elemental Eye, Atropus the World Born Dead, Pandorym the Utter Annihilation, Haemnathuun the Blood Lord, Maram of the Great Spear, Tyranthraxus the Flamed One, the unnamed Queen of Chaos, and Father Llymic, the Alien Thought Given Flesh.
The extent to which these beings have power beyond their native environments varies, as do notions of their relative strength. But they are all forces of corruption and evil. Nothing good can come from their influence. No bargain made with them ends in anything other than madness, plague, death, or worse.</text>

			<name>Elder Evil Blessings</name>
			<text>Through generations of study and grim practice, the disciples of certain Elder Evils have mastered the ability to bestow supernatural gifts on minions they select for the privilege. Any creature that serves a cult of Elder Evil, including a star spawn, can be given one of these rewards — usually as compensation for faithful service, but sometimes as a chance for a creature that breached the cult’s laws to redeem itself. The following powers are unique to specific cults, and typically a creature has no more than one of them.
Cult of Borem of the Lake of Boiling Mud
Borem’s Embrace (1/Day). The cultist touches one creature within 5 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or be coated in sticky, steaming mud. While it is coated in this way, the target’s speed is halved, it can’t use reactions, and it takes 10 (3d6) fire damage at the start of each of its turns. The effect lasts for 1 minute, until the cultist is incapacitated or dies, or until the target is immersed in water.
Cult of Atropus the World Born Dead
Gaze of Corruption (Recharge 6). The cultist targets one creature it can see within 30 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 16 (3d10) necrotic damage and be poisoned for 1 minute. The poisoned target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
Cult of Haask the Voice of Hargut
Haask’s Presence (1/Day). The cultist transforms into a Tiny, leech-like being and teleports onto the shoulder of a humanoid that it can see within 30 feet of it. The targeted humanoid must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or be charmed by the cultist. While the target is charmed, the cultist has control of it on the target’s next turn. At the end of that turn, the cultist teleports to an unoccupied space it can see within 30 feet of it and returns to its normal form. The cultist can’t be targeted directly by any attack or other effect while it’s in the slug-like form, but it is subject to areas of effect as normal.
Cult of Tyranthraxus the Flamed One
Radiant Flames (1/Day). Multihued flame surrounds the cultist for 1 minute, until the cultist is incapacitated or dies, or until the cultist extinguishes the flame (no action required). While inflamed, the cultist has telepathy with a range of 30 feet, and it can teleport as a bonus action up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space it can see. In addition, every creature that starts its turn within 5 feet of the cultist must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 16 (3d10) radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
Cult of Tharizdun the Chained God
Tharizdun’s Spark (Recharge 6). As a bonus action, the cultist touches a simple or martial weapon or a natural weapon, if it has one. The next creature hit by the touched weapon must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or experience short-term madness for 10 minutes. Consult the Short-Term Madness table (see “Madness Effects” in chapter 8 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide) to determine the form of the madness. The affected creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each minute, ending the effect on itself on a success.</text>

			<name>Star Spawn</name>
			<text>The Material Plane represents only one small part of the multiverse. Beyond the best-known planes of existence lie realms that are lethal to mortal life. Some are so hostile that even a moment’s contact with such a place is enough to plunge a mortal mind into madness. Yet beings do exist that are native to these realms: beings that are eternally hungering, searching, warring, sometimes dreaming. These Elder Evils are far older than most of the mortal races and always horrific to humanoid minds.
However much they might desire to enter and dominate the Material Plane, the Elder Evils are unable or unwilling to leave their realms. Some are imprisoned in their dimensions by external forces, some are inextricably bound to their home realities, and others simply can’t find any way out.
Heralds of Doom. The creatures known as star spawn are the heralds, servants, foot soldiers, and lieutenants of the Elder Evils, capable of taking on forms that can journey to the Material Plane. They arrive most often in the wake of a comet — or perhaps such a phenomenon merely signals that star spawn are in the vicinity and available for communication. When the signs are right, warlocks and cultists hasten to gather together, read aloud their blasphemous texts, and conduct the mind-searing rituals that guide the blazing star spawn into the world.</text>

			<name>Star Spawn Larva Mage</name>
			<text>A larva mage is a nightmarish combination of a mortal body and otherworldly substance. When a powerful cultist of a wormlike entity such as Kyuss or Kezef — usually a warlock or other spellcaster — contacts the comet-borne emissary of an Elder Evil, the emissary can merge with a mortal consciousness to create a larva mage. None of the original cultist’s personality survives the transformation, so what emerges is wholly alien.</text>

			<name>Star Spawn Seer</name>
			<text>A star spawn seer is most often encountered as the leader of a cult that worships one or more of the Elder Evils. Usually, the seer is the only cult member that grasps the full extent of the horror the cult is venerating.
An entity that appears as a star spawn seer in the Material Plane usually arrives as something different — something disembodied. When a warlock or other spellcaster establishes communication with it, the seer-entity takes control of the mortal’s form and spirit, transforming it into a star spawn seer. Whoever the seer once was largely vanishes beneath the corpulent bulk of tumorous skin than builds up in strange whorls all over the seer’s body. Hands become bulky, flipper-like appendages capable of grasping their strange staffs — formed of some blend of flesh, bone, and star stuff — but clumsy and painful when used to manipulate other things.
A star spawn seer is almost always accompanied by one or more star spawn hulks. Although the hulk is a worthy combatant in its own right, it’s also a vital part of a tactic often used by seers. When a seer deals psychic damage to a hulk, the hulk isn’t hurt, while the effect ricochets off the hulk and expands to assault other creatures.
The seer’s goal is to tap the energy sources and master the rites that will enable it to extend a bridge between the vulnerable sanity of the Material Plane and the squirming madness of an Elder Evil’s prison.</text>

The names given to these terrible entities include such strange descriptions as Ityak-Ortheel the Elf-Eater, Dendar the Night Serpent, Borem of the Lake of Boiling Mud, Kezef the Chaos Hound, Zargon the Returner, Camnod the Unseen, Holashner the Hunger Below, Piscaethces the Blood Queen, Shothotugg the Eater of Worlds, Y’chak the Violet Flame, Bolothamogg Who Watches from Beyond the Stars, Hargut of the Gray Pestilence, Haask the Voice of Hargut, Ragnorra the Mother of Monsters, the Hulks of Zoretha, Kyuss the Worm That Walks, Tharizdun the Elder Elemental Eye, Atropus the World Born Dead, Pandorym the Utter Annihilation, Haemnathuun the Blood Lord, Maram of the Great Spear, Tyranthraxus the Flamed One, the unnamed Queen of Chaos, and Father Llymic, the Alien Thought Given Flesh.
The extent to which these beings have power beyond their native environments varies, as do notions of their relative strength. But they are all forces of corruption and evil. Nothing good can come from their influence. No bargain made with them ends in anything other than madness, plague, death, or worse.</text>

			<name>Elder Evil Blessings</name>
			<text>Through generations of study and grim practice, the disciples of certain Elder Evils have mastered the ability to bestow supernatural gifts on minions they select for the privilege. Any creature that serves a cult of Elder Evil, including a star spawn, can be given one of these rewards — usually as compensation for faithful service, but sometimes as a chance for a creature that breached the cult’s laws to redeem itself. The following powers are unique to specific cults, and typically a creature has no more than one of them.
Cult of Borem of the Lake of Boiling Mud
Borem’s Embrace (1/Day). The cultist touches one creature within 5 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or be coated in sticky, steaming mud. While it is coated in this way, the target’s speed is halved, it can’t use reactions, and it takes 10 (3d6) fire damage at the start of each of its turns. The effect lasts for 1 minute, until the cultist is incapacitated or dies, or until the target is immersed in water.
Cult of Atropus the World Born Dead
Gaze of Corruption (Recharge 6). The cultist targets one creature it can see within 30 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 16 (3d10) necrotic damage and be poisoned for 1 minute. The poisoned target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
Cult of Haask the Voice of Hargut
Haask’s Presence (1/Day). The cultist transforms into a Tiny, leech-like being and teleports onto the shoulder of a humanoid that it can see within 30 feet of it. The targeted humanoid must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or be charmed by the cultist. While the target is charmed, the cultist has control of it on the target’s next turn. At the end of that turn, the cultist teleports to an unoccupied space it can see within 30 feet of it and returns to its normal form. The cultist can’t be targeted directly by any attack or other effect while it’s in the slug-like form, but it is subject to areas of effect as normal.
Cult of Tyranthraxus the Flamed One
Radiant Flames (1/Day). Multihued flame surrounds the cultist for 1 minute, until the cultist is incapacitated or dies, or until the cultist extinguishes the flame (no action required). While inflamed, the cultist has telepathy with a range of 30 feet, and it can teleport as a bonus action up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space it can see. In addition, every creature that starts its turn within 5 feet of the cultist must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 16 (3d10) radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
Cult of Tharizdun the Chained God
Tharizdun’s Spark (Recharge 6). As a bonus action, the cultist touches a simple or martial weapon or a natural weapon, if it has one. The next creature hit by the touched weapon must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or experience short-term madness for 10 minutes. Consult the Short-Term Madness table (see “Madness Effects” in chapter 8 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide) to determine the form of the madness. The affected creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each minute, ending the effect on itself on a success.</text>

			<text>Giant hunting spiders, steeders prowl the depths of the Underdark. Most steeders are encountered in the company of duergar.
Female Dominance. Female steeders grow larger and stronger than males, and the female often devours the male after breeding. In captivity, males are used as draft animals, while females serve as steeds in battle.
Lone Predators. Steeders consider other steeders as enemies and attempt to tear apart perceived threats. Their duergar handlers must stable steeders separate from one another and place blinders on them when they’re put to work to keep them from attacking each other.
Low Cunning. Steeders are intelligent enough to learn simple hand signals and vocal commands, but even a domesticated steeder can turn against its handler. Training these beasts requires a rider to bond with the steeder, a process that begins shortly after the creature hatches. The rider stays with the steeder as it grows to full size, working throughout that time to channel the beast’s predatory instincts.
Deadly Hunters. Rather than spinning webs, steeders excrete a viscous substance from their legs. This goo allows them to creep along walls and ceilings and to grapple prey.</text>

			<name>Steel Predator</name>
			<text>A steel predator is a merciless machine with one purpose: to locate and kill its target regardless of distance and obstacles.
Modron Engineering. Steel predators are created by a particular hexton modron, using a machine located in the city of Sigil. It wasn’t always headquartered in the City of Doors, however. On its original home, the plane of Mechanus, the ingenious hexton was lauded for its invention — until it turned its creations against its superiors. Steel predators wreaked havoc across the modron hierarchy until the rogue hexton was trapped and exiled. Now it operates a shop in Sigil where, for a steep price, anyone can commission the manufacture of a steel predator.
Assassins on Demand. To create a steel predator, the hexton’s machine must be fed something that identifies the predator’s target, such as a lock of hair, a well-worn glove, or a much-used weapon. The moment the newly manufactured steel predator emerges, it bounds away in search of its prey. It senses the location of its target across planar boundaries, but such detection is accurate only to within a thousand yards; to close the remaining distance, the steel predator locates its prey by sight and smell.
Once battle is joined, the predator ignores every other threat to attack its target, unless other creatures prevent it from reaching the target. In that case, it does what it must to fulfill its mission.
Rogue Killers. If all goes according to plan, a steel predator slays its target and then voluntarily returns to Sigil, where it’s broken down into parts that can be used in another steel predator. Battle damage can cause this instinct to fail, however, causing the steel predator to linger in the area, hunting and killing other creatures that resemble its target, that fit the target’s general description, or that simply live nearby. Such rogues become the most dangerous of predators.
Constructed Nature. A steel predator doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.</text>

			<name>Stone Cursed</name>
			<text>The stone cursed are spawned through a foul alchemical ritual performed on a humanoid that has been turned to stone. The ritual, which requires a mixture of basilisk blood and the ashes from the burned feathers of a cockatrice, awakens a dim echo of the petrified victim’s spirit, animating the statue and turning it into a useful guardian.
Lingering Spirits. The stone cursed possess a malevolent drive to slay the living, yet they are utterly loyal to whoever performed the ritual to animate them, and they obey that being’s orders to the best of their ability.
In combat, stony claws that drip with thick, gray sludge emerge from a stone cursed’s fingers. This alchemical sludge transforms those slashed by the claws into statues.
A Strange Harvest. As part of the ritual used to create a stone cursed, a fist-sized obsidian skull forms within the creature’s torso. The skull isn’t visible while the stone cursed is active, but when it is slain, the statue shatters and the skull clatters to the ground. Because it is the nexus for the alchemy used to create these horrors, a dim echo of the original victim’s memories resonates within the skull. A skilled magic-wielder can attempt to extract memories from it to gain insight into the victim’s past or find lore that otherwise would be lost.
Constructed Nature. A stone cursed doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.
CRYPTIC WHISPERS
Even though creatures transformed into stone cursed are long dead, a vague whisper of their memories lives on in the obsidian skull embedded within the stone cursed’s body. At the end of a short rest, a character can make a DC 20 Intelligence (Arcana) check to attempt to extract a memory from the skull — a memory that is a response to a verbal question posed by the character to the skull. Once this check is made, whether it succeeds or fails, the skull can’t be used in this manner again.</text>

Brooding Spirits. The most likely spots for encountering sword wraiths are scenes of ancient ambushes, battlefields where soldiers were felled by magic with no chance to fight back, and sites where enemies were hemmed in and slaughtered without quarter.

Little pleases them more than hearing a ballad performed in their honor. Towns located near ancient battlefields hold annual festivals of remembrance to keep sword wraiths there placated.

			<text>Tortles are omnivorous, turtle-like humanoids with shells that cover most of their bodies. Tortles have a saying: “We wear our homes on our backs.” Consequently, tortles feel little need to stay put for long.
An adult tortle stands about 6 feet tall and weighs between 450 and 500 pounds. Males and females are nearly identical in size and appearance.
Temporary Towns. A tortle settlement is primarily used as a kind of moot, where tortles can socialize with one another and trade with strangers. Tortles don’t regard these settlements as places worth defending with their lives, and they abandon a settlement when it no longer serves their needs.
A Life of Wandering. Most tortles like to see how other creatures live and discover new customs. The urge to procreate doesn’t kick in until the end of a tortle’s life, and a tortle can spend decades away from its native land without feeling homesick.
Tortles view the world as a place of everyday wonder. They live for the chance to hear a soft wind blowing through palm trees, to watch a frog croaking on a lily pad, or to stand in a crowded marketplace.</text>

			<name>Tortles</name>
			<text>Tortles are omnivorous, turtle-like humanoids with shells that cover most of their bodies. Tortles have a saying: “We wear our homes on our backs.” Consequently, tortles feel little need to stay put for long.
An adult tortle stands about 6 feet tall and weighs between 450 and 500 pounds. Males and females are nearly identical in size and appearance.
Temporary Towns. A tortle settlement is primarily used as a kind of moot, where tortles can socialize with one another and trade with strangers. Tortles don’t regard these settlements as places worth defending with their lives, and they abandon a settlement when it no longer serves their needs.
A Life of Wandering. Most tortles like to see how other creatures live and discover new customs. The urge to procreate doesn’t kick in until the end of a tortle’s life, and a tortle can spend decades away from its native land without feeling homesick.
Tortles view the world as a place of everyday wonder. They live for the chance to hear a soft wind blowing through palm trees, to watch a frog croaking on a lily pad, or to stand in a crowded marketplace.</text>

		<legendary>
			<name>Dire Troll</name>
			<text>Trolls kill and eat almost anything — including, in rare cases, other trolls. This cannibalism has the effect of causing the troll to grow to an unusually large size. These dire trolls crave more and more troll flesh to fuel their continued growth.
Dire trolls also increase their size by grafting flesh and organs onto themselves. When a slab of quivering troll flesh is bound against a fresh wound on the dire troll, its regenerative capacity incorporates the new mass into its own musculature. Even more horrifying are the multiple arms, eyes, claws, and other organs that a dire troll tears from its victims and grafts onto itself. Over time, these creatures can accumulate many limbs.
VAPRAK THE DESTROYER
Although trolls are hardly devout and seldom ponder spiritual questions, they do fear and venerate the entity known as Vaprak the Destroyer. As with many lesser deities, Vaprak’s true nature is something of a mystery, but it is always portrayed as a horrid, misshapen, greenish creature strongly resembling a troll. It’s given to fits of mindless destruction and is constantly paranoid about the plots and ambitions of other deities.
Among trolls, Vaprak is believed to devour those on the brink of death, but only if the troll is already cooked or digested (slain by fire or acid). Otherwise, the god spits the soul back into the world to regenerate a new body, no matter how little of its previous form remained. Thus, only trolls slain by acid or fire remain dead, because only those are consumed by Vaprak.</text>

			<text>A troll that is infused with waves of necrotic energy as it regenerates can develop a symbiotic relationship with that deathly power. The troll’s body withers, and its flesh falls away from the body as quickly as it forms. Eventually a rot troll becomes unable to regenerate, though it still heals normally. The creature courses with necrotic energy that flows out of its withered form. Simply standing near a rot troll exposes other creatures to its lethal emanations.</text>

			<text>In billowing clouds of fog lurk vampiric mists, the wretched remnants of vampires that were prevented from finding rest. Indistinguishable from the mists they lurk within, they strike unseen and undetected to bleed their victims dry.
Former Vampires. Vampiric mists, sometimes called crimson mists, are all that remain of vampires who couldn’t return to their burial places after being defeated or suffering some mishap. Denied the restorative power of these places, the vampires’ bodies dissolve into mist. The transformation strips the intelligence and personality from them until only an unholy, insatiable thirst for blood remains.
Blood Thief. Indistinguishable from fog aside from the charnel reek it exudes, a vampiric mist descends on a creature and causes the blood in its body to ooze through the creature’s pores or spill out from its eyes, nose, and mouth. This blood wafts out from the victim like crimson smoke, which the mist then consumes. The feeding causes no pain or discomfort to the victim, so vampiric mists can feed on sleepers without waking them. The more a mist feeds, the redder it gets, such that it turns pink, then red, and finally a deep scarlet hue that rains blood droplets wherever it goes.
Attracted to Blood. Like sharks in water, vampiric mists can scent blood from up to a mile away. Any injury, no matter how small, might catch their attention and draw them toward their victims. In battle, a mist focuses its attacks on injured targets, since open wounds are a more ready source of blood.
Undead Nature. A vampiric mist doesn’t require air or sleep.</text>

			<text>Canoloths prefer to enter into contracts to guard valuable treasures and important locations. They always do exactly as asked — never any more, never any less.
With senses sharp enough to pinpoint the locations of nearby invisible creatures, canoloths respond unfailingly to any threat to their charges. Furthermore, they emit a magical distortion field that prevents creatures close to them from teleporting.
Canoloths confront intruders with swift and terrible force, projecting long, spiny tongues to grab their foes and drag them close. What happens next depends on the contract. Unless instructed to kill, a canoloth merely holds onto its prisoner, but if given the order to do so, it tears its prey limb from limb.</text>

			<text>Mercenaries that ply their trade throughout the Lower Planes and in other realms, yugoloths have a reputation for effectiveness that is matched only by their desire for ever more wealth. Although yugoloths aren’t especially loyal and typically try to exploit every potential loophole in a contract, they undertake any task for which they are hired, no matter how despicable. Yugoloths come in a wide variety of forms, including those described in the Monster Manual and the six creatures presented here.</text>

			<name>Dhergoloth</name>
			<text>Dhergoloths rush into battle like whirlwinds of destruction, lashing out with five sets of claws, which extend from their squat, barrel-shaped bodies. They take contracts to put down uprisings, clear out rabble, and eliminate scouts and skirmishers, and they revel in the butchery they create, their unhinged laughter rising above their victims’ screams.
Since dhergoloths are little more than dumb brutes, employers must use caution when instructing these fiends. They can handle simple orders that don’t take a lot of time to resolve. When given anything complex to do, they either forget what they’re told or don’t listen in the first place, and then bungle the task that was set for them.</text>

			<text>Like the thought-stealing waters of the River Styx they inhabit, hydroloths filch the memories of creatures they attack, stealing away their thoughts for delivery to whatever master they happen to serve. Hydroloths are skilled at finding lost things, especially those that have been swallowed up in the deeps.
For amphibious assaults or underwater conflicts, hydroloths have no equal among yugoloths. They sometimes hire themselves out to attack and scuttle ships and raid coastal settlements.</text>

			<name>Merrenoloth</name>
			<text>The grim, gaunt captains of the ferries on the River Styx, merrenoloths have total command of their vessels, ensuring that their passengers reach their destinations safely. Sometimes merrenoloths can be coaxed away from the Lower Planes to captain other vessels, affording those ships and crews the same protection.
Whenever a merrenoloth takes on a contract to captain a ship, it bonds with the vehicle to make sure nothing goes awry with it during the journey. A merrenoloth can navigate its ship safely through the worst storms, always stays on course, and never runs afoul of the myriad hazards that can thwart lesser captains.
A merrenoloth can hold its own in a fight, but it prefers to avoid combat when possible. In fact, it typically specifies in its contracts that it is under no obligation to fight. A merrenoloth’s first duty is always to its vessel.
Lair Actions
Any ship a merrenoloth is contracted to captain becomes the creature’s lair. When fighting on the ship, the merrenoloth can invoke its ability to take lair actions. On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the merrenoloth can take one lair action to cause one of the following effects; it can’t use the same effect two rounds in a row:
The ship regains 22 (4d10) hit points.
A strong wind propels the ship, increasing its speed by 30 feet until initiative count 20 on the next round.
The air within 60 feet of the ship is filled with howling wind. Until initiative count 20 on the next round, that area is difficult terrain, and when a Medium or smaller creature flies into that area or starts its turn flying there, it must succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.
Regional Effects
A merrenoloth imbues its vessel with powerful magic that creates one or more of the following effects:
The ship doesn’t sink even if its hull is breached.
The ship always stays on course to the destination the merrenoloth names.
Creatures the merrenoloth chooses to take on the ship aren’t discomfited by wind or weather, though this effect doesn’t protect against damage.
If the merrenoloth dies, these effects fade over the course of 1d6 hours.</text>

			<name>Bringer of Plagues (Recharge 5-6)</name>
			<text> As a bonus action, the oinoloth blights the area within 30 feet of it. The blight lasts for 24 hours. While blighted, all normal plants in the area wither and die, and the number of hit points restored by a spell to a creature in that area is halved.
Furthermore, when a creature moves into the blighted area or starts its turn there, that creature must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, the creature is immune to the oinoloth’s Bringer of Plagues for the next 24 hours. On a failed save, the creature takes 14 (4d6) necrotic damage and is poisoned.
The poisoned creature can’t regain hit points. After every 24 hours that elapse, the poisoned creature can repeat the saving throw. On a failed save, the creature’s hit point maximum is reduced by 5 (1d10). This reduction lasts until the poison ends, and the target dies if its hit point maximum is reduced to 0. The poison ends after the creature successfully saves against it three times.</text>

			<name>Oinoloth</name>
			<text>Grim specters of death, oinoloths bring pestilence wherever they go. To armies who recognize their awful forms, their mere appearance causes soldiers to break ranks and flee, lest they succumb to one of the awful plagues that oinoloths let loose.
Oinoloths provide the ultimate solution to thorny problems, usually by killing everyone involved. They are hired as a last resort, when a siege has gone on too long or an army has proved too strong to overcome. Once summoned, oinoloths stalk the killing field, poisoning the ground and sickening creatures they encounter. Sometimes they might be hired to lift the very plagues they spread, but the price for such work is high, and the effort turns the creatures they save into debilitated wrecks.</text>

			<name>Yagnoloth</name>
			<text>Anyone who would contract yugoloths for a task usually ends up dealing with a yagnoloth. Cunning negotiators, these strange fiends handle the writing of contracts for all of their kind. Once a yagnoloth is hired, it communicates its employer’s desires to the fiends it commands.
Although they are entrusted with leading lesser yugoloths, yagnoloths ultimately take their orders from arcanaloths and ultroloths. Aside from their superiors, yagnoloths have full authority over and expect obedience from the fiends under their command. A yagnoloth follows the dictates in a contract it negotiated, but it is certain to have included a loophole to escape its obligation if the situation warrants.
A yagnoloth has one arm of human size and one giant-sized arm, and it always covers one or the other with a long cape. During negotiations, the yagnoloth uncovers its human arm and uses it to draft and sign contracts. When a show of force is necessary or when combat is joined, it shifts its cape to reveal its brutally powerful giant appendage.</text>
