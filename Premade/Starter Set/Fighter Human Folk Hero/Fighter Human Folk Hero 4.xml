				<text>You can speak, read, and write Common and one extra language of your choice. Humans typically learn the languages of other peoples they deal with, including obscure dialects. They are fond of sprinkling their speech with words borrowed from other tongues: Orc curses, Elvish musical expressions, Dwarvish military phrases, and so on.</text>

				<name>Copper (cp)</name>
				<text>Common coins come in several different denominations based on the relative worth of the metal from which they are made. The three most common coins are the gold piece (gp), the silver piece (sp), and the copper piece (cp).

With one gold piece, a character can buy a belt pouch, 50 feet of good rope, or a goat. A skilled (but not exceptional) artisan can earn one gold piece a day. The gold piece is the standard unit of measure for wealth, even if the coin itself is not commonly used. When merchants discuss deals that involve goods or services worth hundreds or thousands of gold pieces, the transactions don't usually involve the exchange of individual coins. Rather, the gold piece is a standard measure of value, and the actual exchange is in gold bars, letters of credit, or valuable goods.

One gold piece is worth ten silver pieces, the most prevalent coin among commoners. A silver piece buys a laborer's work for a day, a flask of lamp oil, or a night's rest in a poor inn.

One silver piece is worth ten copper pieces, which are common among laborers and beggars. A single copper piece buys a candle, a torch, or a piece of chalk.

In addition, unusual coins made of other precious metals sometimes appear in treasure hoards. The electrum piece (ep) and the platinum piece (pp) originate from fallen empires and lost kingdoms, and they sometimes arouse suspicion and skepticism when used in transactions. An electrum piece is worth five silver pieces, and a platinum piece is worth ten gold pieces.

A standard coin weighs about a third of an ounce, so fifty coins weigh a pound.

			<name>Human</name>
			<text>Humans are the youngest of the common races, late to arrive on the world scene and short-lived in comparison to dwarves, elves, and dragons. But they are the innovators, the achievers, and the pioneers of the world, the most adaptable and ambitious people among the common races.
	When humans settle somewhere, they stay. They build cities to last for the ages and great kingdoms that can persist for centuries. They live fully in the present—making them well suited to the adventuring life—but also plan for the future, striving to leave a lasting legacy.
	Human culture varies by region. In the Forgotten Realms, the clothing, architecture, cuisine, music, and literature in the northwestern lands of Neverwinter are different from their counterparts in distant Turmish or Impiltur to the east. Human physical characteristics vary according to the ancient migrations of the earliest humans, so that the humans of Neverwinter have every possible variation of coloration and features.

Having so much more variety than other cultures, humans have no truly typical names. Some human parents give their children names from other languages, such as Dwarvish or Elvish (pronounced more or less correctly). Traditional names among different human cultures vary widely. You might be Haseid (Calishite), Kerri (Chondathan), Kosef (Damaran), Amafrey (Illuskan), So-Kehur (Mulan), Madislak (Rashemi), Mei (Shou), or Salazar (Turami).</text>

			<name>Fighter</name>
			<text>Fighters are the most diverse class of characters in the worlds of Dungeons &amp; Dragons. Questing knights, conquering overlords, royal champions, elite foot soldiers, hardened mercenaries, and bandit kings—as fighters, they all share an unparalleled mastery with weapons and armor, and a thorough knowledge of the skills of combat. And they are well acquainted with death, both meting it out and staring it defiantly in the face.</text>

			<name>Background</name>
			<text>Your parents lived in the prosperous village of Thundertree, east of the city of Neverwinter and at the edge of the Neverwinter Wood. But when nearby Mount Hotenow erupted thirty years ago, your parents fled, carrying you in your infancy. Your family drifted from village to village around the region, finding work as servants or laborers where they could.
	You've spent the last few years in Neverwinter as a porter and laborer at the city's bustling docks. But it's clear to you and everyone around you that you are destined for much more. You stood up to an abusive ship captain once, so other dockworkers look up to you. Someday, you'll come into your own. You'll be a hero.

	Personal Goal: Drive Off the Dragon. The ruins of Thundertree call to you. Your family and their friends once lived in prosperity there, and now they're reduced to menial labor. The ruins are haunted by ash zombies, and rumor has it a dragon has made its lair in the Old Tower, but those are problems a hero can solve. Slay the dragon, or drive it off, and you'll prove—to yourself and everyone else—you're a real hero, destined for greatness.

	Alignment: Lawful Good. A hero stands up to evil and never lets bullies have their way. A hero fights for law and order, so that everyone can live in prosperity and happiness. A hero slays monsters, clears ruins, and protects the innocent. You strive to be such a hero.</text>
