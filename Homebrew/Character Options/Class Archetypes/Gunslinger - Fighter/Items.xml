		<text>Reload: The weapon can be fired a number of times equal to its Reload number before the wielder must spend an Attack or an Action to reload. You must have one free hand to reload a firearm.</text>
		<text />
		<text>Misfire: Whenever you make an attack roll with a firearm, and the dice roll is equal or lower than the weapon’s misfire score, the weapon misfires. The attack misses, and the weapon cannot be used again until you spend an action to try and repair it. To repair your firearm, you must make a successful Tinker’s Tools check (DC equal to 8 + Misfire score).</text>
		<text />
		<text>Ammunition: You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack. At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield.</text>
		<text />
		<text>If you use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an improvised weapon.</text>
		<text />
		<text>Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.</text>
