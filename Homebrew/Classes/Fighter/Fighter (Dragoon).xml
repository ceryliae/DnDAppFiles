			<feature optional="YES">
				<name>Martial Archetype: Dragoon</name>
				<text>A mounted soldier's primary objective is to carve a swath through the enemy lines, breaking the ranks of footmen for his or her infantry to exploit. Dragoons are elite combatants, selected from the ranks of standard cavalry soldiers for their prowess in battle and exceptional mounted dexterity. Their specialized training focuses as much on scouting and survival as it does advanced unit tactics, creating warriors who are just as effective on their own as with the main body of an army.</text>
				<text>	A dragoon's effectiveness comes from seamlessly weaving a variety of weapons into mounted tactics in order to control the ebb and flow of the battlefield and halt any retreat.</text>
				<text>	While the refined techniques of the dragoon are typically employed by the regimented armies of humans, elves, and dwarves, there are tribes of barbarians and even wolf-mounted goblins that have cultivated a form of this style with their favored blade or axe.</text>
			</feature>
			<feature optional="YES">
				<name>Dragoon: Cavalry Weapons: Haft or Hilt</name>
				<text>Issued upon the entrance to training, sabers are the typical dragoon's weapon of choice. These weapons share the length and weight of a longsword, with the curvature of a scimitar, and are designed to be light enough for use in one hand, but not for two-weapon combat. A cavalry weapon can be any one-handed weapon that deals bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage and doesn't have the light or finesse properties. When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, your cavalry weapon deals 1d8 damage, regardless of its damage die.</text>
				<text>	In trained hands, the saber is a graceful and deadly weapon but even a seasoned fighter might find them clumsy when dealing with its balance. Certain culture's dragoons might favor raiding axes or falchions but it is common practice for units to be familiar with the weapons and tactics of their counterparts.</text>
			</feature>
			<feature optional="YES">
				<name>Dragoon: Elevated Control</name>
				<text>While cavalry traditionally refers to a mounted soldier on horseback, many armies cultivate whatever animal is best suited to the purpose in that region. While unusual, it isn't unheard of for camels, elephants, or even giant reptiles to serve such a purpose in wartime. When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you have advantage on Wisdom (Animal Handling) and Charisma (Persuasion) checks made to influence any beast with the capacity to be used as a mount.</text>
			</feature>
			<feature optional="YES">
				<name>Dragoon: Versatile Combatant</name>
				<text>At 3rd level, through rigorous training your mastery of cavalry weapons makes you effective in heavy armor, but even more so in medium or light armor, allowing a rakish freedom to press a tactical advantage in any situation. In exchange for heavy armor's protection, mounted or not, you gain maneuverability and precision. When wearing medium armor, you add double your Strength modifier to damage rolls with your cavalry weapon and your speed increases by 5 feet. While you're mounted, the speed of your mount also increases by 5 feet.</text>
				<text>	When unarmored, or wearing light armor, your proficiency bonus is doubled for any attack rolls you make with your cavalry weapon, in addition to the benefits of wearing medium armor, and your speed increases by an additional 5 feet, to a total of 10 feet. While you're mounted, the speed of your mount also increases in this way.</text>
				<text>	Additionally, when you use the Attack action to attack with a cavalry weapon, you can use a bonus action to attack with a loaded one-handed ranged weapon you are holding. Being within 5 feet of a hostile creature doesn't impose disadvantage on this ranged attack.</text>
			</feature>
		</autolevel>
		<autolevel level="7">
			<feature optional="YES">
				<name>Dragoon: Line Breaker</name>
				<text>At 7th level, you have learned to identify the break points in the enemy's line and can clear the way for your allies to follow. When you take the Attack action, you can forgo one of your attacks and use your Move action to move least 20 feet in a straight line. When you do so, each creature in your path must make a Strength saving throw with a DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier. On a failed save, a creature is pushed 5 feet in a direction of your choice and falls prone.</text>
				<text>	Creatures have disadvantage on this saving throw if you are mounted.</text>
			</feature>
		</autolevel>
		<autolevel level="10">
			<feature optional="YES">
				<name>Dragoon: Flanking Maneuvers</name>
				<text>At 10th level, your battlefield awareness allows you to sense a retreat and cut it off as it happens. When you hit a creature with an opportunity attack, you can move up to half your speed immediately after the attack as part of the same reaction. This movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks.</text>
				<text>	Starting at 18th level, if you make a melee attack against a creature, that creature can't make an opportunity attack against you for the rest of your turn.</text>
			</feature>
		</autolevel>
		<autolevel level="15">
			<feature optional="YES">
				<name>Dragoon: Strategic Stride</name>
				<text>Starting at 15th level, moving through difficult terrain costs you, or your mount, no extra movement. You can also pass through nonmagical plants without being slowed by them and without taking damage from them if they have thorns, spines, or a similar hazard.</text>
				<text>While traveling for an hour or more while mounted, you gain the following benefits:</text>
				<text>• Difficult terrain doesn't slow your group's travel.</text>
				<text>• Your group can't become lost except by magical means.</text>
				<text>• Even when you're engaged in another activity while traveling (such as foraging, navigating, or tracking), you remain alert to danger.</text>
				<text>• If you are traveling alone, or with up to nine other mounted creatures, you can move stealthily at a normal pace.</text>
				<text>• While tracking other creatures, you also learn their exact numbers, their sizes and how long ago they passed through the area.</text>
