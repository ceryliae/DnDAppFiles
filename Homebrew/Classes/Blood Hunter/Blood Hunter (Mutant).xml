		<name>Blood Hunter (Mutant)</name>
		<autolevel level="3">
			<feature optional="YES">
				<name>Blood Hunter Order: Order of the Mutant</name>
				<text>The process of consuming the Hunter's Bane is a painful, scarring, and often fatal experience. Those that survive find themselves irrevocably changed, enhanced. Some found this experience exalting, embracing the ability to alter one's own physiology through corrupted alchemy.</text>
				<text>	Over generations of experimentation, a splinter order of blood hunters began to emerge, one that focused on brewing toxic elixirs to modify their capabilities in battle, altering their blood and, over time become something beyond human. They called themselves the Order of the Mutant.</text>
			</feature>
			<feature optional="YES">
				<name>Order of the Mutant: Formulas</name>
				<text>You begin to uncover forbidden alchemical formulas that temporarily alter your mental and physical abilities.</text>
				<text>	Beginning at 3rd level, you choose to learn three mutagen formulas. Your formula options are detailed at the end of this order description. You gain an additional formula at 7th, 10th, 15th, and 18th level.</text>
				<text>Additionally, when you gain a new mutagen formula, you can choose one of the formulas you already know and replace it with another mutagen formula.</text>
			</feature>
			<feature optional="YES">
				<name>Order of the Mutant: Mutagen Craft</name>
				<text>At 3rd level, you can take a short rest to concoct a single mutagen. Consuming a single mutagen requires a bonus action, and the effects (including side effects) last until you take a short or long rest to mediate and flush the toxins from your system.</text>
				<text>Mutagens are designed for your biology. They have no effect on large or larger creatures, and only impart the side effects on other medium or smaller creatures that drink the entire mutagen. They are also unstable by nature, losing their potency over time and becoming inert if not swallowed before you finish your next short or long rest.</text>
				<text>Your body will begin to better utilize the toxins you instill it with as you grow in power and experience. These advancing mutations may be signified by a Mutation score.</text>
				<text>	Mutation Score = your blood hunter level divided by 4, rounded up.</text>
			</feature>
			<feature optional="YES">
