				<text>This class and all Orders, including Order of the Lycan, designed by Matthew Mercer and are available on dmsguild.com</text>

			<feature>
				<name>Hunter's Bane</name>
				<text>Beginning at 1st level you have survived the imbibing of the Hunter's Bane, a poisonous alchemical concoction that alters your life's blood, forever binding you to the darkness and hoping your senses against it.</text>
				<text/>
				<text>	You have advantage on Wisdom (Survival) checks to track Fey, Fiends, and Undead, as well as on Intelligence checks to recall information about them. If you are actively tracking one of these creature types, you cannot be surprised by any creatures of that type. You can only be tracking one type of creature at a time.</text>
				<text/>
				<text>	Upon reaching 11th level, you can flare the internal toxic scars from the ritual, using the pain to give clarity, or promote anger. You can choose to suffer damage equal to your crimson rite damage die to gain advantage on a Wisdom (Insight) check or Charisma (Intimidation) check.</text>
			</feature>
			<feature>
				<name>Crimson Rite</name>
				<text>At 1st level, you learn to invoke a rite of blood magic within your weapon at the cost of your own vitality. Choose to learn one rite from the Primal Rites list below. You cannot change this choice.</text>
				<text>	As a bonus action, you imbue a single weapon with the elemental energy of a known rite for up to 8 hours. While active, attacks from this weapon deal an additional 1d4 rite damage of the chosen elemental type. Rite damage is considered magical. The rite damage die changes as you gain blood hunter levels, as shown in the crimson rite damage table. Should your weapon leave your grip, the rite fades immediately. An active rite on a weapon thrown fades directly after the attack is complete.</text>
				<text>	When a crimson rite is activated, it reduces your maximum hit points a number equal to your character level. These lost maximum hit points return once the rite fades and cannot be restored otherwise. When a rite fades, no hit points are regained as part of the restoring of maximum hit points.</text>
				<text>	Crimson rite can be used on multiple weapon, costing additional hit point loss. Most weapons can only be subject to a single rite at any given time. Each end of a polearm or quarterstaff is treated as a separate weapon for the purposes of this feature. A rite can be allowed to fade at any time (no action required).</text>
				<text>	You gain access to an additional Primal Rite at 6th level and 11th level. You may learn an Esoteric Rite at 14th level.</text>
			</feature>
			<feature optional="YES">
				<name>Crimson Rite: Primal Rites</name>
				<text>Choose from the following:</text>
				<text>  • Rite of the Flame. Your rite damage is fire type.</text>
				<text>  • Rite of the Frozen. Your rite damage is cold type.</text>
				<text>  • Rite of the Storm. Your rite damage is lightning type.</text>
			</feature>
			<feature optional="YES">
				<name>Crimson Rite: Esoteric Rites</name>
				<text>  • Rite of the Roar. Your rite damage is thunder type.</text>
				<text>  • Rite of the Oracle. Your rite damage is psychic type.</text>
				<text>  • Rite of the Dead. Your rite damage is necrotic type.</text>
			</feature>

				<name>Fighting Style</name>
				<text>At 2nd level, you adopt a style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options. You can't take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.</text>
			</feature>
			<feature option="YES">
				<name>Fighting Style: Archery</name>
				<text>You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls you make with ranged weapons.</text>

			<feature>
				<name>Blood Hunter Order</name>
				<text>At 3rd level, you commit to an order of blood hunter martial focus. Choose Order of the Mutant, Order of the Ghostslayer, Order of the Profane Soul, or Order of the Lycan. The order you choose grants you features at 3rd level, and again at 7th, 11th, 15th, and 18th level.</text>
				<text>	There are a handful of secretive orders of blood hunters that guard their cryptic techniques and blasphemous rituals. One must adhere to one of these orders to even be granted access to the Hunter's Bane rite that starts their journey, and only once they've proven their ability will the secrets of the order begin to be revealed. Some even wait a few years before they are sure they want to continue down this cursed path. Either or, it's within these small, enigmatic sects that the real power of a blood hunter is learned.</text>

				<name>Blood Maledict</name>
				<text>At 6th level, you gain the knowledge to further channel, and sacrifice, a part of your vital essence to curse and manipulate your enemies. You gain two (2) blood curses of your choice, detailed in the "blood curses" section below. You learn one (1) additional blood curse of your choice at 9th, 13th, 17th level.</text>
				<text>	When you use your Blood Maledict, you choose which curse to invoke. While invoking a blood curse, but before it affects the target, you may choose to AMPLIFY the curse by suffering damage equal to your crimson rite damage die. An amplified curse gains an additional effect, noted in the curses description. Creatures that do not have blood in their bodies are immune to blood curses (DM's discretion).</text>
				<text>	You can use this feature twice. You regain expended uses when you finish a short or long rest. Beginning at 11th, you can use your Blood Maledict three times between rests, and at 17th, you can use it four times between rests.</text>
			</feature>
			<feature optional="YES">

				<text>As a bonus action, you can attempt to bind an enemy no more than one size larger than you within 30 feet.

				<text>	AMPLIFY: This curse becomes ongoing, and can affect a creature no more than two sizes larger than you. At the end of each of its turns, the cursed can make another Strength saving throw. On a success, this curse ends. You can end the curse whenever you like (no action required).</text>
			</feature>
			<feature optional="YES">
				<name>Blood Curse: Blood Curse of the Eyeless</name>
				<text>When an enemy with eyes within 30 feet makes a weapon attack against you, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack.</text>
				<text>	AMPLIFY: The triggering attack can be targeting a creature other than yourself.</text>
			</feature>
			<feature optional="YES">
				<name>Blood Curse: Blood Curse of the Fallen Puppet</name>
				<text>The moment a creature falls unconscious or dies within 30 feet of you, you can use your reaction to give that creature a final act of aggression. That creature immediately makes a single weapon attack against a target of your choice within its attack range. After the attack, the creature returns to being unconscious or dead.</text>
				<text>	AMPLIFY: You grant a bonus to the attack roll and damage roll of the cursed creature's attack equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of 1).</text>
			</feature>
			<feature optional="YES">
				<name>Blood Curse: Blood Curse of the Fending Rite</name>
				<text>When an enemy casts a spell that requires a Dexterity saving throw, you can use your reaction to deflect the spell with your crimson rite.

				<text>	AMPLIFY: You grant all allies within 5 feet of you this bonus to their saving throw against the triggering spell as well.</text>

			</feature>
			<feature optional="YES">
				<name>Blood Curse: Blood Curse of Mutual Suffering</name>
				<text>As a bonus action, you can link to a creature within 30 feet for up to a minute, forcing them to share in the pain they inflict upon you. The next time the cursed creature damages you with a weapon attack, this curse deals necrotic damage to the cursed creature equal to half of the damage you suffered. This curse then ends.</text>
				<text>	AMPLIFY: This curse instead deals damage equal to the damage you suffered, and it ignores necrotic resistance.</text>
			</feature>
			<feature optional="YES">
				<name>Blood Curse: Blood Curse of Purgation</name>
				<text>As a bonus action, you can manipulate the vitality of a creature within 30 feet to expunge a corruption in their blood. The target creature can immediately make a swing throw against a poisoned condition afflicting it.</text>

			</feature>
			<feature optional="YES">
				<name>Blood Curse: Blood Curse of Spell Sunder</name>
