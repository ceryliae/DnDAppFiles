				<name>Divine Domain: Fire</name>
				<text>The mortal races have long had a strong connection to fire; it is the mastery of fire that is the first technology developed by any group clawing its way toward civilization. Fire is a primal force, and the gods who claim fire as a part of their portfolio are often similarly primal. Fire is a cornerstone of civilization, and yet at the same time it is never truly tamed; its presence invokes wariness of danger, and it remains strongly associated with unpredictability, destruction, and catastrophe. Clerics who have been granted the blessings of the Fire domain are often similarly regarded: though on the outside they might appear calm and in control, inside them roils a dangerous power that, when stoked and unleashed, can do as much to unmake civilization as to prop it up. Even at their calmest, clerics with this domain give the impression that smoldering embers lie just out of sight, waiting on the right trigger to fan the flames waiting at their fingertips.</text>
