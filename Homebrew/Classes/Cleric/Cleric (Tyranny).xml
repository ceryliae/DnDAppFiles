				<name>Divine Domain: Tyranny</name>
				<text>At heart, the Tyranny domain reflects the urge to impose one's will on others. Expressions of tyranny can be found throughout the world, from the monarch whose word is law, to the powerful crime lord who takes control of a city's underworld. Merchants who have a monopoly over a crucial commodity, a benevolent dictator whose good intentions mask intolerance for competing views, or even the conquering general who always looks ahead to the next nation to fall under her control are further representations and find appeal in serving gods who would strengthen their authority. The gods of tyranny send their clerics to support these individuals, to help them expand their dominions, and silence any opposition they might face.

		<autolevel level="2">
			<feature optional="YES">
				<name>Tyranny Domain Channel Divinity: Invoke Authority</name>
				<text>Beginning at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to impose your will on other creatures.</text>
				<text>	As an action, you present your holy symbol and chan- nel divine authority at one creature you can see within 60 feet of you. Constructs are immune to this effect. The target creature must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a success, the creature becomes immune to this effect until you finish a long rest. On a failure, the creature becomes compelled until the start of your next turn. While compelled, when the creature takes its next turn, you can tell it what to do on its turn, deciding how it moves and uses an action. If the creature refuses, it takes psychic damage equal to 1d6 + half your level.</text>
