				<name>Divine Domain: Repose</name>
				<text>For some cultures, death is a thing to be feared, and as such, those cultures' gods of death are often figures of foreboding and evil. For others, death is merely a transition, and the gods of death are shepherds of souls, carrying them on to the next realm. For clerics of this latter kind of death god, the Repose domain represents the gifts of these gods, focusing on ensuring that malign forces do not interrupt the natural cycle of life and death. Clerics with the Repose domain also gain mastery over many things that are a part of death, such as stillness, unawareness, and nonexistence. More than anything, clerics of the Repose domain excel at seeking out the abomination that is the undead, and correcting the  aw that their existence has introduced into the natural order.</text>
