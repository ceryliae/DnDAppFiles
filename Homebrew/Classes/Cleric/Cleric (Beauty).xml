				<name>Divine Domain: Beauty</name>
				<text>Gods of beauty embody all that is lovely, charming, and beautiful in the world, from the qualities of attractiveness to the profound beauty of nature.  ey are often gods of love, lust, or sexuality as well, although some are more focused on purely aesthetic beauty, or patrons of the arts or performance. Although usually kind and good, deities of beauty can sometimes be vain and petty, especially in contests of skill or attractiveness. Beauty can also be deceptive, and not all gods associated with this domain are as pleasant as they seem. Aymara, a God of the Womb, includes Beauty in her portfolio.</text>
