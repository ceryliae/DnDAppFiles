				<name>Divine Domain: Balance</name>
				<text>There cannot be good without evil, law without chaos, light without dark. These forces act in the cosmos, striving for dominance, but always checked by their opposite. Their conflict creates stability in the universeâ€”a stability that must be preserved so existence can continue. Gods of balance preserve the delicate equilibrium between cosmic forces to ensure all things work as they should. They tend to be impartial gods, moved to action only when the scales tip toward one side or the other. They then throw their weight behind the weaker force until balance is restored. Most gods of balance focus on one of good versus evil or law versus chaos.</text>
