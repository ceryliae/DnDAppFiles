				<name>Divine Domain: Water</name>
				<text>Few clerics are granted powers that encompass elements that are simultaneously fundamental to the flourishing of life and capable of wiping away all traces that life was once there. Water takes many forms; so too do the powers granted to clerics of this domain. A cleric devoted to a god with dominion over water can call to hand the force of a rushing river current, summon the relentless, crashing power of the tides, or conjure the bitter cold of a blizzard. Clerics with this domain can summon or vanish into blinding mists, walk across the bottom of a lake without harm, and harness the catastrophic power of a flood. Many different deities grant the powers of the water domain to their followers: gods of the sea, gods of the rain and snow, and gods of rivers, lakes, and streams.</text>

			<feature optional="YES">
				<name>Water Domain Channel Divinity: Crashing Waves</name>
				<text>Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to summon the power of the crashing waves to strike at your enemies.</text>
				<text>	When you hit an enemy with a melee weapon attack, you can use your Channel Divinity as a bonus action to cause a wave of divine power to wash out over each enemy you choose that is within 10 feet of the target of the attack. For each of those creatures, if the attack roll of the weapon attack equals or exceeds that creature's Armor Class, that creature takes bludgeoning damage equal to the weapon's damage die + your Wisdom modifier (plus any extra damage gained from the Divine Strike feature once you reach 8th level).</text>

When you reach 14th level, the extra damage increases to 2d8.</text>
