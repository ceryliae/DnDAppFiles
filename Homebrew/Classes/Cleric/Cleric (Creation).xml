				<name>Divine Domain: Creation</name>
				<text>Almost every culture has a legend about where the world came from, and many of them center on the idea that the world as the mortal races know it is a creation made by a divine hand. The gods of the Creation domain might be revered as the creators of the world, or they might simply be worshiped as the gods who hold dominion over forges, craftsmen, shipwrights, artists, and other makers. Of course, there is also an aspect of creation that clears away the rubble of the old before the new can be made; for every making, there is also an unmaking. Clerics gifted with the powers of the Creation domain are highly valued by the leaders of expeditions, as their ability to conjure up just what the expedition needs on a moment's notice allows the group to quickly deal with any adversity that might come their way.</text>

			<feature optional="YES">
				<name>Creation Domain Channel Divinity: Divine Fabrication</name>
				<text>Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to create objects using the powers of the divine forges.</text>
				<text>	You can spend 1 minute presenting your holy symbol and describe a nonmagical inanimate object that can fit entirely within a cube that is 10 feet on each side. The object appears on the ground in an unoccupied space you choose within 30 feet of you; if there is not enough room for the object to be created in such a space, you cannot use your Channel Divinity in this way.  e object you describe must be one that you have seen before, and must have a value of less than 3,000 gp. The object is visibly crude, though perfectly functional, obviously magical (covered in a shimmering sheen visible even in dim light), and lacks any kind of  ne detail or ornamentation. The object disappears after 1 hour, or if you use this feature again, or if you are ever more than 30 feet away from the object.</text>
