				<name>Divine Domain: Earth</name>
				<text>The gods of the earth have dominion over the solid foundations upon which the world is built. These gods not only command stones and move mountains, but also hold sway over the fertile soil in which plants grow, the precious gems and metals mortal races draw from mines deep beneath the ground, and the deep caverns and subterranean realms that form the pillars upon which the surface world rests. There is a strong bond between the Earth domain and the mortal races; it is in the earth that farmers work to grow the crops needed to feed their families, and in the earth that miners delve to retrieve the stones and metals necessary to build the fundamental structures of civilization. Clerics bestowed with the powers of the Earth domain carry with them the strength and immovability of stone, and use their divinely-granted gifts to protect those around them from harm.</text>
