			<feature optional="YES">
				<name>Divine Domain: Zeal</name>
				<text>The God-Pharaoh expects those he welcomes into the afterlife to desire it above all other pleasures and achievements, and for them to show their dedication, passion, and fervor through their actions. Hazoret is charged with cultivating this zeal in the initiates who come under her care, and she has undertaken the task with appropriate enthusiasm. She recognizes, however, that the best way to teach zeal is by demonstrating it.</text>

		</autolevel>
		<autolevel level="8">
			<feature optional="YES">
				<name>Zeal Domain: Divine Strike</name>
				<text>At 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes with divine energy. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 damage of the same type dealt by the weapon to the target. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage increases to 2d8.</text>

			<feature optional="YES">
				<name>Zeal Domain: Blaze of Glory</name>
				<text>Starting at 17th level, you can delay death for an instant to perform a final heroic act.</text>
				<text>	When you are reduced to 0 hit points by an attacker you can see, even if you would be killed outright, you can use your reaction to move up to your speed toward the attacker and make one melee weapon attack against it, as long as the movement brings it within your reach. You make this attack with advantage. If the attack hits, the creature takes an extra 5d10  re damage and an extra 5d10 damage of the weapon's type. You then fall unconscious and begin making death saving throws as normal, or you die if the damage you took would have killed you outright.</text>
				<text>	Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.</text>
