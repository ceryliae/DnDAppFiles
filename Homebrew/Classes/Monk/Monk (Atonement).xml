				<name>Monastic Tradition: Way of Atonement</name>
				<text>Monks of the Way of Atonement seek absolve themselves for their past transgressions, sins, and current indiscretions by giving up their possessions and atoning through peaceful and selfless service. Seeking not the zealot's path, they believe that through calming and controlling their fervor, they can bolster the universal well-being of all mortal creatures. These monks seek to protect delicate balance struck by the presence of the pantheons and strike out in malice only to defend those who can't defend themselves from the greater evils that lurk within this realm and beyond.</text>
				<text>	Feared by those with wealth, and praised by those who lack it, these monks are easy to spot in their dusty burlap robes and bare feet. The Atoned sacrifice, not only in material possessions but, flesh to find their way to forgiveness and often carve or brand the markings of the gods on their skin in homage.</text>
				<text>	In exchange for the strength to seek perfect purity in an existence full of ambition and hubris, followers of this path endeavor to abstain from anger, envy, and corruption. Not so naiÌˆve as to believe that the gods' designs won't require skirting the edges of temptation, and sometimes justify ends by their means, they willingly pay the price in flesh for their actions. As part of their atonement, they learn to encourage wicked and vile denizens of their world to repent using only a heavy, unadorned club that each refers to as their penance.</text>
				<text>	To take this path, the acolyte must commit to the poorest lifestyle, renouncing all that they were before atonement.</text>

				<name>Way of Atonement: Atonement</name>
				<text>When you choose this tradition at 3rd level, you can channel your vitality to fuel your wrath. You have a pool of Atonement Dice, represented by a number of d8s equal to your monk level which you can use to empower your Way of Atonement features.</text>
				<text>	You regain all expended dice when you atone at the end of a short or long rest.</text>
				<text>	Atonement requires deep contemplation, and usually making amends for the pain you inflict on others by inflicting that pain on yourself during contemplation or prayer. To atone, roll the Atonement Dice you spent and add them together. You deal bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage to yourself equal to the total. You deal this damage after you regain hit points from any Hit Dice you spend at the end of a short or long rest.</text>

				<name>Way of Atonement: Penance</name>
				<text>Also at 3rd level, you learn a ritual prayer that creates a divine bond between you and one of civilization's earliest weapons, the club. You perform these prayers over the course of 1 hour, which can be during a short rest.</text>
				<text>	During this ritual, you carve notches that represent your past atonements, and each time you take a short rest, you're compelled to consider any additional sins you have committed and add notches to its stock to atone. While your penance is paid, your weapon is bonded to you, counts as your monk weapon, and can't be disarmed of that weapon unless you are incapacitated.</text>
