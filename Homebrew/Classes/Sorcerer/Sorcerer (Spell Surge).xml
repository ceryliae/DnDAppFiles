				<name>Sorcerous Origin: Spell Surge</name>
				<text>The Spellsurge is an individual suffused by vast amounts of raw arcane power, typically from birth, as a result of powerful outside magic weaving itself into their DNA. A lich's dark phylactery, a djinni's golden lamp, or the storied Bluestones of Tremahia are all examples of objects capable of infusing an individual with the magic they radiate. Arcana comes easily to these seeming savants, and without the rigorous study of wizards, or the guiding patron of warlocks, the Spellsurge's magic can manifest in a myriad of unpredictable and often dangerous forms. But unlike Wild Magic sorcerers, who seek to harness their magic by twisting the threads of fate, a Spellsurge accepts the consequences of their sheer, unbridled power--and sets it free. Without control, these individuals often fall victim to themselves. But through a combination of talent, grit, and determination, a Spellsurge can learn to channel that might, and unleash it in ways that ba e even the greatest mages.</text>

				<name>Spell Surge: Untamed Power</name>
				<text>The Spellsurge's approach to magic is direct and powerful--garnering these sorcerers reputations as "brutes" of the arcane world. Starting when you choose this origin at 1st level, your veins course with wild, surging magic, increasing the damage of your spells by an amount equal to one third of your Sorcerer level (rounded down).</text>
				<text>	In addition, whenever you cast a spell of Level 1 or higher, roll a d10: on a critical hit, a 10 on the d10, or at the DM's discretion, you must roll on the Surge table to create an additional random magical effect. Upon rolling a critical failure with a spell, or a 1 on the d10, you must roll specifically on the Backfire spell table, and the random magical effect replaces the initial spell. Spells with multiple attack rolls trigger only once. You may spend 1 Sorcery Point to quell a surge or backfire, but you must choose to do so before rolling on the table.</text>

			</feature>
			<feature optional="YES">
				<name>Spell Surge: Arcane Anomaly</name>
				<text>Though lacking the in-depth knowledge of studied wizards, you are naturally gifted in the arcane arts, manifesting and manipulating magics beyond your understanding. At 1st level, you gain the ability to cast one spell as an "Arcane Anomaly" once per Long Rest. This must be a spell from the Bard, Warlock, or Wizard lists, and must be of a level for which you have spell slots. In order to cast your Anomaly, you must use the spell's appropriate cast time to make a Charisma (Performance) check, with DC equal to 10 + the spell level. On a success, the spell is immediately cast using the appropriate slot; on a failure, neither the ability nor the spell slot activate, but you can reattempt on future turns. You can take Disadvantage to roll on the Surge Table, or Advantage by rolling on the Backfire table (if successful, the spell is not replaced). Your Spellcasting Ability for these spells is Charisma.</text>
				<text>	You gain one additional use of Arcane Anomaly at 5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th levels. Whenever you do so, you may take one more qualified spell as an Arcane Anomaly. Once chosen, spells cannot be changed.</text>
			</feature>

		<autolevel level="6">
			<feature optional="YES">
				<name>Spell Surge: Synergy</name>
				<text>Starting at 6th level, you are able to weave some of your untamed magic into the spells you cast. Once per Long Rest, you can tap into pockets of your simmering power, and pair a spell with a Surge or Back re option of your choosing, excluding #45-50 on the Surge Table. You can make the decision after casting the spell, but before the effect takes place.</text>
			</feature>
		</autolevel>
		<autolevel level="14">
			<feature optional="YES">
				<name>Spell Surge: Cry Havoc</name>
				<text>At 14th level, you have opened the floodgates of your incredible, raw power, allowing it to surge through you and pour into the spells that you cast. At the start of your turn, you may choose to forgo movement and activate this feature, entering a supercharged magical state. While channeling this ability, your spell attacks are made with advantage, and saving throws against your spells are made with disadvatage. However, attacks targeting you are also made with advantage, and you automatically fail Dexterity saving throws. The effect lasts for 1 minute, and ends early if you use movement, lose control of your character, or leave the current plane.</text>
				<text>	You can use Cry Havoc a number of times equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum of 1) without penalty, replenishing on a Long Rest--for each additional use, you suffer one level of Exhaustion.
				</text>
			</feature>
		</autolevel>
		<autolevel level="18">
			<feature optional="YES">
				<name>Spell Surge: Transcendence</name>
				<text>By 18th level, you discover a means to fully unleash your magic, and allow it to flow freely through you. The ebbing tide of arcana has altered your body, subtly enhancing your mental and physical fortitude. Becoming more and more a being of energy incarnate, magic itself begins bending to your will. You gain the following:</text>
				<text>• Your Constitution Score and Cap both increase by 2.</text>
				<text>• You gain access to #45-50 on the Surge Table when using your "Synergy"feature.</text>
				<text>• You are able to cast the Thaumaturgy cantrip, and without a verbal component.</text>
				<text>• You can use your Reaction to force a creature within 60 feet to make a Constitution saving throw against your Spell Save DC in order to maintain Concentration.</text>
				<text>In addition, you gain up to three distinctive physical traits that serve as manifestations of your surging power: glowing white eyes, crackling electricity, or billowing blue flame are all examples of potential trait options. You are able to activate these traits at will, and the DM can choose to grant Advantage or Disadvantage on specific Charisma checks while they are active, depending on the trait and situation.</text>
