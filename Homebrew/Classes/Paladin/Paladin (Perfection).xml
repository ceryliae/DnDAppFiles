			<feature optional="YES">
				<name>Sacred Oath: Oath of the Perfection</name>
				<text>Though many would perceive those who swear the Oath of Perfection as arrogant and prideful, nothing could be further from the truth. Paladins who swear this oath are driven to excel, and fear no hard work to do so. The Oath of Perfection urges paladins who swear it to become the best swordsmen, peerless riders, paragons of virtue, and fearless leaders. A paladin who swears the Oath of Perfection seeks  awless beautyâ€”beauty in the most perfect strike of a sword that wastes no effort, beauty in the perfectly chosen word to sway the mind of the king, beauty in taking that one perfect step to avoid the charging manticore. The paladins who swear this Oath are constantly honing their skills and seeking to better themselves, and their internal perfection is often reflected by an outward flawlessness.</text>
				<text/>
				<text>Tenets of the Perfection</text>
				<text/>
				<text>Swearing an Oath of Perfection is a pledge to always strive to be the very best and eradicate one's  aws. An Oath of Perfection is an oath of personal achievement and refinement; while some who swear such an oath might encourage others around them to similarly strive for perfection, the tenets of an Oath of Perfection bind only the paladin who gives it.</text>
				<text>	Eliminate Flaws: To reach the apex of your skill, you must focus  rst on eliminating  aws. Keep yourself free or corruption, vice, and weakness. So too should you strive to eliminate those who corrupt and wound the world around you; if something is willfully making the world worse, it is your sacred duty to stop it.</text>
				<text>	Perfection Comes Through Practice: There is no such thing as natural perfection; you might be gifted in an area, but you are not born perfect. Only through hard work, continuous practice, and constant reflection and self-evaluation can perfection be achieved.</text>
				<text>	Blemishes are to be Pitied, Not Scorned: Not everyone can devote their lives to the pursuit of perfection and mastery, and the world is full of people who are flawed, physically or otherwise. They are not to be scorned, shunned, judged, or rejected. Instead, it is your duty to offer them comfort, succor, and aid.</text>
				<text>	Only the Gods can be Truly Perfect: No matter how great your skill, no matter how perfect your execution, no matter how beautiful your appearance, you will never achieve perfection. Do not allow yourself to give into the flaw of pride by believing that you are perfect in any way; only the gods can be truly perfect, and you are no god.</text>
