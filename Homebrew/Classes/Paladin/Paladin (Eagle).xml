			<feature optional="YES">
				<name>Sacred Oath: Oath of the Eagle</name>
				<text>The paladins that swear the Oath of the Eagle see the eagle as a symbol of all that should be aspired to, and the Oath takes the attributes of those majestic birds and transforms them into edicts to live by. These paladins admire eagles not only for their beauty and splendor, but also their nobility, their speed, their awareness, and their skills as hunters. Most of all, paladins who swear the Oath of the Eagle look up to the sky and see the eagle in flight as a symbol of liberation, and seek to break the chains that bind any mortal and prevent them from soaring just the same.</text>
				<text/>
				<text>Tenets of the Eagle</text>
				<text/>
				<text>The tenets of the Oath of the Eagle transform the eagle from a symbol into practical guidance on living one's life. While most who swear this Oath recognize that these tenets are built heavily on symbolism and allegory, they nonetheless willingly embrace the idealistic mantras.</text>
				<text>	Freedom Above All: None can reach the heights that the eagle does when they are chained to the ground. Fight slavery and imprisonment wherever you can, and oppose those tyrants who would restrict the freedoms of their people.</text>
				<text>	Shine as a Symbol: You are an example to others; just as you once gazed up to the skies and saw the soaring eagle above you, so too will others look up to you and see your deeds and triumphs. Always remember that you exemplify not only the tenets of your Oath, but all those of your order. Give those who look upon you something to aspire to.</text>
				<text>	Be a Relentless Hunter: Do not flag in your pursuit of your enemies. When you drive off slavers and tyrants, give them no chance to escape; pursue, and bring them down. The enemies of your order cannot be allowed to flee from the justice of your grasp.</text>
				<text>	Soar to the Greatest Heights: Always strive to achieve great things. Reach for the skies in all things, and never be satisfied with your deeds. There is always more to be done, and every triumph you complete elevates both you and the other members of your faith.</text>
