				<name>Sacred Oath: Oath of the Mercy</name>
				<text>Though armed and armored, not all paladins seek out battle as the primary means of spreading their faith. For many, the sword and shield are tools of last resort, and a victory on the battle eld is bittersweet at best. Paladins who swear the Oath of Mercy dedicate themselves to using their divine gifts and physical strength to healing the wounded, tending to the sick, and defending those who cannot defend themselves. In many ways, these paladins follow a path much closer to the clerics of many orders, yet they still retain the ability to be a dangerous force in any battle. For the paladins who adhere to an Oath of Mercy, their offensive weapons are to be kept in reserve until there is no other option, and they use their inherent charm to defang arguments before their venom can spill over into physical con ict.</text>
				<text/>
				<text>Tenets of the Mercy</text>
				<text/>
				<text>The tenets of the Oath of Mercy are similar in many ways to the doctrines adhered to by clerics of the Life domain. Paladins who swear an Oath of Mercy dedicate themselves to bringing peace and restoring the health and vitality those who suffer, and the tenets of that Oath guide them along a path of gentility and kindness.</text>
				<text>	Seek Peace: Be ever the diplomat and peacemaker. When a con ict threatens to erupt in violence, be at the ready to defuse it with words and overtures. It is not enough to avoid conflict yourself; you must seek out those who would  ght and do your best to placate them without violence.</text>
				<text>	Give Succor: If you are not able to prevent the out- break of violence, it is your sacred duty to tend to those who are its victims. You have been gifted with the ability to heal wounds, cure poisons, and lift diseases; such a gift is wasted if it is not used. Tend to the wounded, the weak, and the ill and put them before yourself.</text>
				<text>	Protect Those Who Need It: Your strength is more than just a weapon; it is a shield. Interpose yourself between those bent on violence and those who cannot defend themselves. Put yourself in harm's way to spare another the pain that violence brings. Do not be afraid to sacrifice your own wellbeing to protect others.</text>
				<text>	Choose Violence Last: Though you should always strive to leave your sword in its sheath, there might come a time when words fail, and you must meet violence with violence. Mercy is not pacifism, and from time to time a rabid dog must be put down for the safety of those around it.</text>
