				<name>Sacred Oath: Oath of the Battle</name>
				<text>While all paladins are, in one respect or another, the faith militant of their respective traditions, those who swear the Oath of Battle place themselves at the forefront of armed conflict. Crusaders of their faith, paladins that swear this Oath spend as much time studying military history and strategy as they do their tenets of their own religion. They are often born leaders, men and women who would rise through the ranks of command in a military organization even without the aid of their deity. More than just good in a fight, paladins who swear the Oath of Battle are invaluable on a battlefield when armies clash, drawing the opposing forces to them and inspiring the troops on their side to ride head-on into battle and win the day.</text>
				<text/>
				<text>Tenets of the Battle</text>
				<text/>
				<text>The tenets of the Oath of Battle come from hundreds of years of military tradition. Despite the differences in the loyalties and composition of varying military orders, there are certain rules, unspoken or otherwise, that have evolved over the years into a creed that paladins who swear the Oath of Battle hold as dear as their own lives.</text>
				<text>	Lead from the Front: Go gallantly and willingly to the front lines, placing yourself in danger to stir the hearts and minds of your companions. You need no standard-bearer; be the standard that draws the eyes of enemies and allies alike to the thickest part of the battle.</text>
				<text>	Comrades Before Oneself: A soldier alone is merely a soldier; many soldiers together are a force to be reckoned with. You are nothing without your comrades in arms; you must put the wellbeing and safety of your battle companions before your own, and when an ally falls, it is your duty to pick them up and carry them to safety if need be.</text>
				<text>	Never Forget the Mission: Do not let anger, revenge, or despair come between you and your goal. Every battle is fought for a reason, and there is an objective to be won that must be remembered always. In every facet of life, remember your mission, and place it before your own desires.</text>
				<text>	Defeat is Not an Option: Never surrender when the fight can still be won. Never abandon your position unless commanded to do so by a superior o cer. Never do anything to endanger the chance for your force to emerge from battle victorious. Fight to the last, but remember that the war is more important than the battle.</text>

Additionally, for the duration, when you take the Attack action on your turn, after you have finished making your attacks you can use your bonus action to make a weapon attack against an enemy you have not attacked this turn.</text>
