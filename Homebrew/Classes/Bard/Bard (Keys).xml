				<text>	When you use your action to disarm, dispel, and when you make a saving throw to dodge a glyph, lock, trap, or ward, or as part of a divination spell to locate or scry with you as the target, you can choose to expend one use of your Bardic Inspiration, rolling a Bardic Inspiration die and adding the number rolled to the skill check or saving throw. You can choose to use this feature after seeing the roll but before the DM determines whether the ability check or saving throw succeeds or fails, or before the trap deals its damage.</text>
