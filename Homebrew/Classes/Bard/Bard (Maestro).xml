				<name>Bard College: College of Maestro</name>
				<text> Music is a powerful thing. You can bolster a burning passion, inspire the meek to bravery, and sooth a cluttered mind. Wondering bards have mastered the art of creating music to shape and manipulate the thoughts and hearts of the world through song, words, and instrument. However, it is the Maestro who is learn to be vocal music from the natural world around them and we have these notes with our team skills and to melodies of dynamic and Potent Magic.</text>
				<text>	With but a raised hand or wand, a Maestro listens for the clanging of arms on armor, the heavy foot falls of a giant, the crackling bolt of lightning, and catches them, crafting them into a symphony of rousing musical movements. They conduct the sounds of the battlefield like a phantom orchestra, empowering the blows of their allies, altering the minds and moved to their opponents, and changing the pace of the fray in their favor.</text>
				<text>	The college of the maestro calls to those who enjoy enabling their companions to become even more adept, working in unison with your Sonata. It refines those of raw talent into majestic performers who can pluck the thoughts from a mind like a musical note, amplify the fears of lesser beings through sourceless, ominous tones, and seemingly stretch time by commanding the tempo of a heartbeat. Maestros become heroes who can take the chaos of the world and carpet as they see fit by controlling the vibrations of music that suddenly guide the realm</text>
