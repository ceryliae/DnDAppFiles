=== '''Witch Doctor Class''' ===

{{5e Image|float:right|http://www.diabloii.net/gallery/data/501/medium/deiv_diablo3_witch_doctor.jpg|by Diev Calviz}}

A twig snaps in the darkness. Rushing footsteps, splashing through the mud--a man races through the misty swamp, gripping a bloody dagger, eyes wide with terror.

"It wasn't supposed to happen like that," he cries out. "She wasn't supposed to die!" He trips over a risen root, falling prone into the shallow marsh. He looks forward for a brief moment, surrounded by the blackness of the moonless swamp...the shadows before him shimmer, and suddenly, he finds himself staring into a familiar pair of white eyes, lit with a faint, otherworldly glow.

"No...but you are."

The man muffles a scream, clutching his dagger tightly as he scrambles back to his feet. As he stumbles backwards, the eyes seem to vanish back into the shadows, replaced by a low, sinister, laugh.  It echoes through the night as the man races frantically for safety.

"Stay away from me, demon!" A branch snaps and he spins about, dagger poised and ready to strike once more. Another noise from behind him and he wheels again...but he finds only darkness, drowned by shadows of the looming cypress that surround him. Suddenly, a soft flitting sound comes from the thick mist around him, and the man feels a light sting as a tiny dart pierces into the side of his neck. He immediately pulls it out with a growl of frustration, throwing it back out into the darkness. "Damn you! Why are you toying with me? I can pay--I can pay well!"  But the laughter continues, and the man staggers back into the fog, feeling an ever-so-faint twinge take hold in his muscles.

Moments later, the gnarled trees and decaying shrubbery begin to disappear as the miasma grows thicker and thicker, enveloping him. He raises his arms to fan a path through, but his limbs begin to tighten and stiffen against his will. A booming voice erupts from the swirling mist:

"You cannot run...and you cannot hide."

Suddenly, the fog pours toward him, and shapes itself into a grotesque face--eyeless sockets chilling him to the bone as the form seems to unhinge its wicked maw. The man screams in terror, using all his strength to stagger backwards away from the horrid visage.

"What are you--what do you want with me?!"

But with each step, the man's muscles lock tighter and tighter--until at last, he can move no more. His eyes, wide with fear, dance frantically side to side as his screams catch in his throat...and a figure steps out of the shadows to his left, the blackness swirling around his towering form: thickly muscled, with dark skin and glowing eyes, face hidden behind a monstrous mask that seems to grin a wicked grin. The figure waves its hand through the air, and seems to slowly pull a jagged, black dagger from the very shadows themselves.

"My name is Mumbo Jumbo, and I am here to claim ya soul."

==='''Creating a Witch Doctor''' ===

So you clearly want to be a master of the dark arts, but what kind of voodoo do you wanna do? There are a few important questions you might want to ask yourself while creating your Witch Doctor:
*''What kind of play style are you looking for?'' Due to it's unique combination of physical and magical abilities, the Witch Doctor provides some fascinating and versatile play styles for just about anyone--if you like the idea of using your brute strength and honed melee skills to overcome your foes, make a bargain with the Ancestral Guardians; if you prefer to alter your own form to adapt to your environment, or ally yourself with beast companions, strike your deal with the Primal Spirits; if you prefer instead to truly master your voodoo magic and weave the fabric of the world to your whim, like the infamous Witch Doctor, Mumbo Jumbo...then sell your soul to the Old God.
*''Good, or not so good?'' As a Witch Doctor, you walk a fine line between good and evil, sanity and insanity. Ask yourself (and your DM) what alignment best suits your character. You can use your abilities to inflict tremendous pain, cripple your enemies, or devour a soul from a living body--but you can also mend the most grievous of wounds, revivify friends and strangers alike, and even breathe life back into an unbeating heart.
*''Are you prepared to be an outcast?'' Witch Doctors are a rare sight no matter where your adventure takes you, and tend to stick out like a sore thumb in any group. Often, a Witch Doctor's appearance can range from extremely odd to downright terrifying, and as such, the average person may react a little differently to them than they would to most other adventurers. Are you able to deal with those possibilities and shrug them off as they come, or are you the type to grow and learn to become more a part of the cultures you encounter?
*''Why are you a member of your party?'' As a Witch Doctor, you likely haven't had a tremendous amount of social contact with the outside world. Are you the type who has been alone for too long and desperately loves and needs companionship? Are you the type who understands the limits of your own power, and joins up with an adventuring party to achieve the greater good which you could not accomplish alone? Or are you one who has ulterior motives of your own, using your allies until you are strong enough to make your move?

<!--'''Class Features'''=-->
==== Medicine Man ====
Gleaned from decades of experience concocting various hoodoo brews and tinctures, the Witch Doctor has developed a natural affinity for healing through natural means, and is twice as effective when using healing potions, salves, or remedies.

==== Head Hunter ====
The Witch Doctor is feared and renowned for his proficiency with a blowgun, particularly with the poison darts that make it so unassumingly dangerous. You are able to use blowguns as a Bonus Action, and start with two dart recipes, gaining new recipes at level 3 (Anesthetic Dart), level 5 (Paralyzing Dart), level 7 (Catalyst Dart), and level 9 (Lethal Dose):
*'''Poison Dart''' [bonus action, reagent required] - coated with common but painful insect venom, the Poison Dart causes 1d4 poison damage on its following turns. Poison Darts stack to a maximum of 4d4, and last 10 minutes unless cleansed.
*'''Rejuvenating Dart''' [bonus action, reagent required] - coated with a mild herbal pain reliever, it is shot into a friendly target to heal them 1d4 on the target’s following turns. Dart healing stacks to a maximum of 8d4, and lasts 10 minutes unless it is dispelled.
*'''Shrunken Heads''' [bonus action, reagents required] - the Witch Doctor also has a penchant for head hunting, collecting the heads of humanoid victims and shrinking them with the assistance of voodoo and hoodoo magic over the course of a long rest. They are often used as means of dispersing the Witch Doctor's poisons over a small area, filled with 10 doses of the specified poison and covering a 20 foot radius—but they can have many other creative uses.

==== Pact Magic ====
Your tireless practice of witchcraft and the Old God’s voodoo have given you facility with spells. See chapter 10 for general rules of spell casting (same mechanics as Warlock). See below for Witch Doctor spell list.

===== Cantrips =====
You know two cantrips of your choice from the Witch Doctor spell list. You learn additional Witch Doctor cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the ‘Cantrips Known’ column of the spell table.

===== Spell Slots =====
The spell table shows how many slots you have. The table also shows what the level of those slots is; all of your spell slots are the same level. To cast one of your warlock spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a spell slot. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a short or long rest.

===== Spells Known =====
At 1st level, you know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the Witch Doctor spell list. The ‘Spells Known’ column of the table shows when you learn more Witch Doctor spells of your choice of 1st level and higher. A spell you choose must be of a level no higher than what’s shown in the table’s ‘Slot Level’ column for your level.  Upon gaining a level, you can replace a currently-known spell with a new one, so long as it is of a level for which you have spell slots.
You

===== Spell Casting Ability =====
Charisma is your spell casting ability for your Witch Doctor spells, so you use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spell casting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

===== Spell Casting Focus =====
You can use your Voodoo Vestments as spell casting foci for your Witch Doctor spells.

==== Dark Bargain ====
At 2nd level, you strike a dark bargain, selling your soul in exchange for for powerful black magic. Your bargain grants you features at 2nd level, and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level.

==== Black Magic ====
In your study of occult lore, you have infused your soul with black magic and forbidden knowledge that imbue you with an abiding magical ability.

At 2nd level, you gain two Black Magic abilities of your choice. Your options are detailed below in the Black Magic List. At 5th level, 7th level, 9th level, 12th level, 15th level, and 18th level, you gain an additional Black Magic ability of your choice, as shown in the ‘Black Magic’ column of the table. Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose to replace one of the abilities you know with another that you could learn at that level.

==== Ability Score Increase ====
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of you choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

==== Possession ====
At 11th level, the Old God bestows upon you another gift—the gift of Possession. You are able to absorb the spirit of another long-dead Witch Doctor, gaining the permanent ability to channel that spirit in order to tap into its power. Choose a 6th-level spell from the Witch Doctor spell list as your Possession spell. You can call upon that spirit to Possess you for a short time, enabling you to cast that spell without expending a spell slot.

At higher levels, you are able to absorb additional and more powerful spirits, allowing you to gain more Possession spells: one 7th-level spell at 13th level, one 8th-level spell at 15th level, and one 9th-level spell at 17th level. Possession resets when you finish a short or long rest.

==== Voodoo Guru ====
At 20th level, the Old God bestows upon you the title of “Voodoo Guru”, and creates a permanent and direct link between itself and the Witch Doctor. Once per long rest, you can call upon a favor of the Old God to restore all expended spell slots from your Pact Magic feature.


----

=== '''Dark Bargains''' ===
The Witch Doctor has chosen to sell his soul for power, but to whom is the question you must face. Choose from three powerful entities: the Primal Spirits, the Ancestral Guardians, or the Old God.

==== Primal Spirits ====  {{5e Image|float:right|https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-jecj4hc-0UA/VVfez-mGH-I/AAAAAAAAD1k/u1JawevwCTM/s319-p/Diablo-3-female-witch-doctor.jpg|by ____ }}
The Witch Doctor has struck his bargain with the spirits of nature, attuning himself to the world around him and gaining the ability to alter himself to reflect his primal connection. Rather than transforming entirely, as a Druid does, the Witch Doctor chooses to reshape his features individually to suit his needs—combined with his natural magics and deeply-ingrained connection with the natural world, he is an extremely versatile figure, able to adapt his own physicality to most any situation he might face.

===== Whisperer =====
At 2nd level, the Witch Doctor learns commune with the spirits of nature, able to speak with and understand them as if they could speak, themselves. You gain Advantage on all Nature and Animal Handling checks, and can cast Speak with Animals at will, without a spell slot or material cost.

===== Partial Transformation =====
At 3rd level, the Witch Doctor's connection to the spirits of nature grants him the ability to alter parts of himself at will. You can choose between several different transformation options, but only one effect can be present at a time. Transforming requires a bonus action, and you can transform a number of times equal to your Witch Doctor level per short or long rest.

*Wolf Head'': You can use Bite Attack for 2d6 piercing damage as a bonus action. You also gain advantage on Perception checks involving hearing or scent.
*Frog Tongue'': You can elongate your tongue to grab or manipulate objects up to 20 feet away, or simply just to gross people out.
*Jaguar Claws'': You are able to make two Claw Attacks for 1d8 slashing damage, but cannot use objects that require hands or cast spells with somatic components.  On a successful hit, the target must succeed at a Constitution Saving Throw or suffer 1d4 bleed damage at the start of their next turn. Bleed damage stacks.
*Crocodile Hide'': You harden your skin into thick, leathery pleats, giving you resistance to your choice of Piercing, Slashing, or Bludgeoning damage for the duration.
*Serpent Body'': Alter your lower half to resemble an anaconda. Your movement speed is halved for the duration, but you gain Advantage on Grapple checks and allows the free use of your hands and arms.
*Bat Wings'': Sprout two large wings from your back, granting you immunity to falling damage and allowing you to Glide at a speed of 60 feet, descending 5 feet per round.

===== Primal Savagery =====
At 6th level, your transformation weapons are considered “Magical” for combat purposes of overcoming resistances and immunity to nonmagical damage, and you can attack twice whenever you choose the “Attack” Action.

===== Shifting Adept =====
At 10th level, the Witch Doctor has become so proficient at his partial transformations that he is able to maintain two at a time. Additionally, you are able to cast Skinwalker once per long rest without consuming a spell slot or material cost.

===== Shaman King =====
At 14th level, you have become a true master of the wilds, effortlessly interacting with the natural world and altering your own physicality, and have gained enhancements to your transformations:

*Wolf Head'':  You gain the ability “Howl” once per short or long rest, which summons a pack of up to 1d4 wolves that remain for up to 1 hour.
*Frog Tongue'': Your tongue's reach is now 30 feet, and can be used to Disarm a target should they fail a Strength check.
*Jaguar Claws'': You are now dextrous enough with your claws to grasp objects and cast spells with somatic components.
*Crocodile Hide'': Your hide is tougher now, and grants you resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.
*Serpent Body'': While successfully grappling an opponent with your tail, you can Constrict the target for 1d8 bludgeoning damage as a Bonus Action once per round.
*Bat Wings'': Your wings are now able to properly carry your weight, allowing you to Fly with at a speed of 60 feet per round.

==== Ancestral Guardians ====
The Witch Doctor has made his bargain with the spirits of his ancestors—ancient and powerful tribal warriors that used their sheer strength and deadly skill to cut down their enemies.  Wielding spears imbued with magic from the spirit realm, the Ancestral Guardians are mighty foes to face on any battlefield.

===== Bad Juju =====
At 2nd level, the Witch Doctor learns to manipulate the ebb and flow of luck itself. When a creature makes  an attack roll against you, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on that roll. If the attack misses, your next attack roll against the creature has advantage if you make it before the end of your next turn. Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

===== Ancestral Spear =====
At 3rd level, the Witch Doctor imbues his Medicine Stick with the power of his ancestors, transforming it into an ornate and magical spear that is partly of the physical plane, and partly of the spirit realm. Your Ancestral Spear is a Magic Weapon for attack and damage resistance purposes, and considered both Throwable and Versatile, dealing 1d10 damage when thrown or wielded with one hand, and 1d12 when wielded with both. If thrown, the Witch Doctor can use a free action to recall the spear to his hand.

===== Tribal Tenacity =====
At 6th level, the Witch Doctor has become even more adept with his Ancestral Spear, allowing him to attack twice instead of once whenever he chooses the Attack action on one of his turns. Additionally, you are able to add your Strength modifier to your spell damage or healing.

===== Totemic Might =====
At 10th level, the Witch Doctor's physicality is imbued with the power of the Ancestral Guardians themselves. You gain advantage on Strength Checks and Saving Throws, and your Ancestral Spear deals extra damage equal to your Charisma modifier.

===== Guardian's Call =====
At 14th level, your connection to your tribal ancestors is so strong that you can call them into the mortal plane for short periods of time. Once per long rest, the Witch Doctor can summon up to 4 Ancestral Guardians into the mortal plane, determined by a 1d4 roll, for a period of 10 minutes. Each Guardian has the same ability scores as the Witch Doctor, and respect the caster's commands, but cannot cast spells. In combat, they roll their own initiative, and will defend the Witch Doctor by default unless commanded otherwise. Ancestral Guardians can also serve as guides, able to help steer unmade decisions in the right direction.

==== The Old God ====
The Witch Doctor has made a pact with an entity known as 'the Old God'. The mysterious and ancient voodoo god of a forgotten age, its nature is utterly foreign to the fabric of reality, thought perhaps to be the eldest of the elder gods of legend. Its motives are incomprehensible, with terrifying secrets and an immense knowledge that mortals could never dare to fathom. And yet you…something about you has caught its unblinking eye, and your destiny has been forever altered. The Old God has soaked into your being, carved itself into your bones, until at last, you can feel its presence in your very soul. In exchange for your devotion, it allows you to draw from it vast knowledge, dark secrets, and incredible power.

===== Soul Drinker =====
Starting at 2nd level, the Witch Doctor learns how to literally devour the soul of a fallen enemy, using it to fuel his own vitality.  When you reduce a hostile creature to 0 hit points with a killing blow, or when the target of your Voodoo Curse is reduced to 0 hit points, you regain hit points equal to your Charisma modifier + your Witch Doctor level (minimum of 1). If you are already at full health, the additional healing is converted into Temporary Hit Points.

===== Mojo =====
At 3rd level, the Old God bestows a gift upon you for your loyal service. You are given a shrunken head Mojo (whose name is incidentally ‘Mojo’), emanating powerful black magic and occasionally coming to life to engage in conversation. Mojo himself is quite a chatterbox with an alcohol problem, and his hard head can be used as a 1d4 bludgeon when held in the off-hand. The Witch Doctor’s Mojo acts as a Tome (Warlock’s Pact of Tome), allowing the bearer to choose three cantrips from any class’ spell list. While the Mojo is on your person, you can cast those cantrips at will. They do not count against your number of cantrips known.

If you lose your Mojo, you can perform a 1-hour voodoo ceremony to get it back—the ritual can be performed during a short or long rest, and you must possess at least one shrunken head reagent. The Old God will imbue another shrunken head with a worthy spirit to replace the last. The previous Mojo turns to ash when replaced or when the Witch Doctor dies.

===== Black Soul =====
At 6th level, the Witch Doctor's soul itself is infused with the darkness emanating from the Old God, granting him access to mysterious magics and primordial power the likes of which he has never known. The Witch Doctor's number of “Spells Known”, “Spell Slots”, and “Possessions” increases by 2, and Voodoo Bolt deals an additional 1d10 damage.

===== Nightmare Mind =====
Starting at 10th level, other beings can no longer enter the terrifying landscape of the Witch Doctor’s mind without your guidance—your thoughts can no longer be read by telepathy or other means unless you allow it. You also have resistance to psychic damage, and whenever a creature deals psychic damage to you, that creature takes the same amount of damage.

===== Bewitch =====
At 14th level, you gain the ability to bewitch another humanoid, bringing them completely and utterly under the Witch Doctor’s control as a “Thrall”. Utilizing an Action, you touch a target incapacitated humanoid and charm them, allowing total control and telepathic communication so long as the Witch Doctor and his Thrall are on the same plane of existence. Effect lasts until either a Remove Curse is cast on it, the charmed condition is removed from it, or you Bewitch another target. Hostile targets must make a successful Wisdom saving throw against the Witch Doctor in order to resist the spell.

----

=== '''Black Magic List''' ===
''Similar to the Eldritch Invocations of a Warlock, but less diverse and more focused on a voodoo flavor. At particular levels, the Witch Doctor gains access to another one of these abilities so long as he meets the prerequisites. Abilities are drawn from a combination of  Invocations and class abilities from prior editions.''

==== Big Bad Voodoo Hoodoo ====
[15th level or higher, action] - once per long rest, the Witch Doctor can perform a ritualistic dance and chant on his turn, supplemented by smoke and powders and various concoctions. He is unable to take any additional movement, action, or bonus action on that turn. On his next turn, he attempts to place a Voodoo Curse on all hostile targets within 30 feet. If the Witch Doctor loses concentration, the turn is wasted and he must begin the ritual again.

==== Envenom ====
[Bargain with Ancestral Guardians, passive] – the ancient spirits have taught you the lost ways of envenoming your Ancestral Spear. Showing you how to carve veins through which your Headhunter Poisons can flow, you effectively allow the spear to inject your deadly poisons into your opponents. Up to 10 doses of poison can be held in the weapon's reservoir, and can be applied upon every successful attack. Envenom poisons stack with Dart poisons, but refilling the reservoir requires an Action.

==== Flesh to Bone ====
[free action] – drawing on the power of the Old God, the Witch Doctor's  bones begin to thicken and grow beneath his skin. Cracking and grinding, they suddenly appear to rip through his very flesh, encasing him in a monstrous armor of protruding bone. Your AC is increased to 16 for the duration, but your movement speed is halved and you are unable to wear armor while the effect persists. Flesh to Bone can be cast or dismissed at will.

==== Hunga Munga ====
[action] - once per short or long rest, the Witch Doctor can use his own life-force to bargain with the darkest spirits from beyond the Veil.  Spending 1 Hit Die, he conjures a wicked black dagger from the spirit realm and viciously rends a foe within striking distance. Make a Spell attack (1d20 + proficiency bonus + spell attack modifier) against a target within 5 feet inflicting 3d10 necrotic damage on hit.  Damage increases by 1d10 for each level of your current max spell level. After the hit, you can continue to spend additional Hit Die to twist the blade, adding each roll individually onto the total damage. If Hunga Munga kills the target, your Hit Die are refunded.

==== Pins and Needles ====
[bonus action] - the Witch Doctor inserts a needle into the voodoo doll, causing excruciating pain and dealing 1d4 internal damage to the target of the Voodoo Curse every round until the bond is broken. If the target is under the effects of Voodoo Boon, a pin is used instead to do 1d4 healing every round until the bond is broken. The total number of pins or needles a Witch Doctor can utilize is equal to his character level. If the voodoo bond is broken, or if the Witch Doctor changes targets, the effects end and the pins and needles must be removed before the next attempt. Additional effects depend on the placement of the needle:

''Head'': Hostile target must succeed at a Constitution saving throw or become blinded.  Friendly target is cured of Blindness and gains Blindsight.

''Arms'': Hostile target must succeed at a Constitution saving throw or subtract the needles' damage from their physical attack damage. Friendly target adds the needles' damage.

''Legs'': Hostile target must succeed at a Constitution saving throw or reduce their movement speed by half—with two needles active in the legs at the same time, the target becomes immobilized. Friendly target is cured of movement-impairment and their movement speed increases by half with one needle, and doubles with two needles.

==== Spirit Animal ====
[Bargain with Primal Spirits, passive effect] - The Witch Doctor is able to choose his Spirit Animal to be his permanent companion. The creature must be a naturally-occurring beast, and have a Challenge Rating equal to or lower than 1/3 of your Witch Doctor level, rounded up. As a Bonus Action, you can also command your Spirit Animal to merge with you for up to 10 minutes, allowing you to replace any of your Ability Scores with those of your companion, and giving you both the abilities and appearance aspects of your Spirit Animal. Due to the taxing nature of merging spirits, you are only able to perform this merger once per long rest.

==== Talking Head ====
[Bargain with Old God, passive effect] - Two heads are better than one, they say!  Aside from being both a drunk and a chatterbox, it turns out the Witch Doctor’s Mojo also has a surprisingly keen memory—particularly for magic. You can now put your Mojo to work memorizing any manner of magical rituals you happen to come across in your adventures, so long as they are less than or equal to half your Witch Doctor level (rounded up). It takes two hours per spell level of rigorous repetition to permanently pound a new ritual into Mojo’s tiny head, as well as 50gp for the necessary alcohol required to bribe him into cooperating. Choose two 1st-level ritual spells from any spell list: those rituals—and any you are able to teach Mojo down the road—are permanently castable, without taking up a spell slot or a ‘spells known’ slot.

==== That Voodoo That You Do ====
[passive effect] – You are able to channel even more dark energy into your Voodoo Bolt. When casting Voodoo Bolt, add your Charisma modifier to the damage roll of any successful hit.

==== Trance ====
[15th level or higher, action] - as an Action once per short or long rest, the Witch Doctor’s arms raise, his eyes roll back, and he falls into an otherworldly trance. While entranced, becomes a conduit of voodoo magic, a vessel of pulsating dark energy.  Until his next turn, he gains advantage to all saving throws, but is unable to make any additional movement, action, or bonus action.  On the following turn, the Witch Doctor comes out of his trance empowered by ancient spirits—he has advantage on Attack rolls, and his next successful damaging or healing ability deals double damage or healing. The effect fades at the end of the turn of your next successful ability. If the Witch Doctor’s concentration is broken during the trance, then the turn is wasted and he must fall back into the trance again.

==== Voodoo Doll ====
[action]

''Voodoo Curse'' : a hostile target must make a Wisdom saving throw, with disadvantage if the doll contains an element that the Witch Doctor has obtained from the target (hair, blood, clothing, fingernail, etc). If target fails, they succumb to the Voodoo Curse: they have disadvantage on action rolls and saving throws, and suffer internal damage from attacks made against the doll regardless of their proximity. The target can continue making Wisdom saving throws (with disadvantage) at the start of every turn in order to break the curse.

''Voodoo Boon'' : A friendly target willingly accepts a voodoo link with the doll, and gains advantage to Attack Rolls and Saving throws for up to 1 hour or until the link is broken. The target is also able to receive any healing done to the doll regardless of their proximity. If the doll is made with a personal ingredient (blood, hair, fingernail, etc.) from the target, the spell no longer requires Concentration and lasts for 1 hour unless broken.

''Consume Doll:'' the Witch Doctor consumes the current Voodoo Doll, healing himself for one tenth of the target's Hit Point maximum (rounded up) and replenishing 1 expended spell slot. Doll is destroyed upon consumption.

=== '''Witch Doctor Glossary of Terms''' ===

'''Acid of Akanawana’hakalugi''' [2nd level spell, action] - The Witch Doctor calls upon the spirit of another ancient and legendary Witch Doctor, channeling the voodoo magic into his own mouth. Turning toward his target, he huffs, and he puffs, and he hocks up a glob  of bubbling green acid, launching it with deadly accuracy right into the face of his unsuspecting victim. He usually laughs afterwards. The attack deals 4d4 acid damage upon hitting, and an additional 2d4 at the end of its next turn. Both initial and secondary damage components increase by 1d4 per slot level above 2nd.

'''Ancestral Spear''' [3rd level feature] - At 3rd level, the Witch Doctor imbues his Medicine Stick with the power of his ancestors, transforming it into an ornate and magical spear that is partly of the physical plane, and partly of the spirit realm. Your Ancestral Spear is a Magic Weapon for attack and damage resistance purposes, and considered both Throwable and Versatile, dealing 1d10 damage when thrown or wielded with one hand, and 1d12 when wielded with both. If thrown, the Witch Doctor can use a free action to recall the spear to his hand. This weapon can also be effectively coated in any Headhunter poisons, applying one dose per successful attack.

'''Anesthetic Dart''' [3rd level feature, bonus action, reagent required] – the Witch Doctor uses his bonus action to modify and coat his next dart with a local anesthetic made from an uncommon mushroom.  Shortening and sharpening the needle, the next Dart used does no damage, and falls to the ground immediately after hitting its mark--but it delivers its contents without the target's knowledge. To anyone not aware of the Witch Doctor's attack, it feels like a small bug bite at worst.

'''Bad Juju''' [6th level feature, reaction] - causes enemy to have disadvantage on attack roll, and if attack misses, the next attack against them gets advantage.

'''Bewitch''' [Black Magic, action] - the Witch Doctor casts a spell over the target humanoid, binding them to his will as a thrall and allowing telepathic communication until either Remove Curse is cast or Bewitch is cast again. Hostile targets must make a successful Wisdom saving throw against the Witch Doctor in order to resist the spell.

'''Big Bad Voodoo Hoodoo''' [15th level or higher, action] - once per long rest, the Witch Doctor can perform a ritualistic dance and chant on his turn, supplemented by smoke and powders and various concoctions. He is unable to take any additional movement, action, or bonus action on that turn. On his next turn, he attempts to place a Voodoo Curse on all hostile targets within 30 feet. If the Witch Doctor loses concentration, the turn is wasted and he must begin the ritual again.

'''Black Needle''' [9th level spell, action] - The Witch Doctor crafts a needle of pure darkness that can be used to instantly kill a creature under the effects of the Witch Doctor’s Voodoo Curse. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw against the Witch Doctor—if it fails, it dies an excruciating and agonizing death as its soul is drawn into the needle. If it succeeds, the needle steals life from the Witch Doctor instead, reducing him to three quarters of his current hit points, rounded up. Cannot instantly kill elite enemies or bosses, and instead deals 100% of the Witch Doctor’s maximum hit points in damage if they fail their saving throw.

'''Black Soul''' [6th level feature] - At 6th level, the Witch Doctor's soul itself is infused with the darkness emanating from the Old God, granting him access to mysterious magics and primordial power the likes of which he has never known. The Witch Doctor's number of “Spells Known”, “Spell Slots”, and “Possessions” increases by 2, and Voodoo Bolt deals an additional 1d10 damage die.

'''Blood of the Old Good''' [4th level spell, action] - The Witch Doctor targets any area in sight within a 150 foot range, and plunges an unseen voodoo blade deep into its surface—he pulls back his arm, carving out a deep fissure in the earth. The fissure erupts with boiling emerald acid, splashing everything in a 20-foot radius.  All creatures in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw—a failed throw results in an initial 10d4 acid damage, and 5d4 acid damage at the end of its next turn. A successful throw results in an initial 5d4 acid damage with no damage on its next turn. Initial damage increases by 2d4 for each slot level above 4th.

'''Catalyst Dart''' [7th level feature, bonus action, reagent required] – the Witch Doctor dips a  dart into a powder of uncommon herbs, spices, and minerals said to react instantly with the various Headhunter poisons and herbal medicines. His next Dart instantly triggers the maximum stack and effect of any Dart poison or medicine present on the target at the end of the Witch Doctor's turn, but dispels them of the affected poisons or medicines immediately after.

'''Cleanse Spirits''' [4th level spell, ritual] - the Witch Doctor performs a voodoo hoodoo ritual to cleanse the targets of harmful magic, curses, diseases, and poisons. However, it does not offer resistance or immunity, and must be cast as a ritual.

'''Consume Doll''' [Black Magic, action] - Consume Doll: the Witch Doctor consumes the current Voodoo Doll, healing himself for one tenth of the target's Hit Point maximum (rounded up) and replenishing 1 expended spell slot. Doll is destroyed upon consumption.

'''Creepy Crawlies''' [3rd level spell, action] - the Witch Doctor summons forth familiar creatures from the swamps he left behind. You may choose 1 creature of CR 2 or lower (swarm of poisonous snakes, giant constrictor snake, allosaurus), 2 creatures of CR 1 or lower (giant spider, giant toad, fire snake), 4 creatures of CR 1/2 or lower (giant wasp, swarm of insects, crocodile), or 8 creatures of CR 1/4 or lower (constrictor snake, giant bat, giant centipede, giant frog, giant lizard, giant poisonous snake, giant wolf spider, swarm of bats, swarm of rats, swarm of ravens, violet fungus).  The summoned creatures are friendly to you and your companions, and roll their own Initiatives as a group. They obey any verbal commands you give them. At higher level slots, more creatures appear: twice as many at 5th level, and three times as many at 7th level.

'''Envenom''' [Bargain with Ancestral Guardians, passive] – the ancient spirits have taught you the lost ways of envenoming your Ancestral Spear. Showing you how to carve veins through which your Headhunter Poisons can flow, you effectively allow the spear to inject your deadly poisons into your opponents. Up to 10 doses of poison can be held in the weapon's reservoir, and can be applied upon every successful attack. Envenom poisons stack with Dart poisons, but refilling the reservoir requires an Action.

'''Fingers of the Old God''' [1st level spell, action] - the Witch Doctor calls upon the power of the Old God—as he braces himself, several long, black otherworldly tendrils erupt from his body, pulsing with dark energy. Each creature within 10 feet that fails a Strength saving throw takes 2d6 necrotic damage and cannot take reactions until its next turn. On a successful saving throw, the creature takes 1d6 necrotic damage with no side effect. The damage increases by 1d6 per slot level.

'''Fire Eater''' [2nd level spell, action] - the Witch Doctor pulls one of the large jugs off his hip and takes a swig of what’s inside. Holding the liquid in his mouth, he tilts his head back, opens his mouth, and snaps his fingers—as he does, a spark of voodoo fire ignites the liquid in his mouth with a green flame.  The Witch Doctor swallows the flames, greenish smoke pouring from his nostrils. As he finds his target, he steadies himself, beats his chest, and opens his mouth once more to unleash three jets of searing voodoo fire at the target or targets. Roll a ranged spell hit for each jet—on a hit, the target takes 2d6 fire damage. Creates one additional jet each slot level above 2nd.

'''Flesh to Bone''' [free action] – drawing on the power of the Old God, the Witch Doctor's  bones begin to thicken and grow beneath his skin. Cracking and grinding, they suddenly appear to rip through his very flesh, encasing him in a monstrous armor of protruding bone. Your AC is increased to 16 for the duration, but your movement speed is halved and you are unable to wear armor while the effect persists. Flesh to Bone can be cast or dismissed at will.

'''Guardian's Call''' [14th level feature, action] - At 14th level, your connection to your tribal ancestors is so strong that you can call them into the mortal plane for short periods of time. Once per long rest, the Witch Doctor can use his action to summon up to 4 Ancestral Guardians into the mortal plane, determined by a 1d4 roll, for a period of 10 minutes. Each Guardian has the same ability scores as the Witch Doctor, and respect the caster's commands, but cannot cast spells. In combat, they roll their own initiative, and will defend the Witch Doctor by default unless commanded otherwise. Ancestral Guardians can also serve as guides, able to help direct unmade decisions in the right direction.

'''Hands of the Old God''' [4th level spell, action] - the Witch Doctor calls directly upon the Old God for a brief moment. Channeling but an infinitesimally small fraction of its attention, the Old God humors him—hundreds of thick, powerful tentacles of pure dark energy tear open the earth in a 20-foot radius around the targeted location, turning the area into ‘difficult terrain’. Should a creature enter the area or begin its turn inside it, that creature must make a Dexterity saving throw or take 3d6 bludgeoning damage and be restrained by the tentacles until the spell ends. A creature starting restrained in the area takes 3d6 bludgeoning damage. Restrained creatures can use their action to make a Strength or Dexterity check against your Spell Save DC—on success, they are freed.

'''Harrowing Haka of Happy Healing''' [2nd level spell, ritual] - the Witch Doctor gives up to six tiny happy hoodoo charms, made out of various strange objects to creatures of his choice. He begins to prepare an elaborate ritual, setting up various candles, incenses, and drawing several uplifting symbols and happy faces all over the the ground in magic powder. He immediately begins a very impassioned dance, and begins to sing a very loud and slightly off-key chant as he prances around the area, lighting his candles and incense as he goes. The Witch Doctor begins not-so-subtly prodding the others to join in, and within 10 minutes, all targets are dancing and singing…though nobody seems to know the moves or the words (probably not even the Witch Doctor). Though awkward, absurd, and a little hard on the hears, the bizarre ritual somehow works—all involved individuals find themselves healed by 2d8 + your Charisma modifier.  Healing increases by 1d8 per slot level.

'''Head Hunter''' [1st level feature] - The Witch Doctor is feared and renowned for his proficiency with a blowgun, particularly with the poison darts that make it so unassumingly dangerous. You start with two basic dart recipes, with additional recipes available at level 3 (Anesthetic Dart), level 5 (Paralyzing Dart), level 7 (Catalyst Dart), and level 9 (Lethal Dose). He also has a penchant for head hunting, collecting the heads of humanoid victims and shrinking them with the assistance of voodoo and hoodoo magic over the course of a long rest, allowing the use of Shrunken Heads as a poison delivery method.

'''Healin’ Hoodoo''' [1st level spell, action] - the Witch Doctor prepares a healing tincture of various hoodoo ingredients and smashes it on a nearby target’s head. When the vial breaks, it covers the target in a small cloud of rejuvenating mist and liquid, healing them for 1d8 + Charisma modifier. The potency increases by 1d8 per slot level.

'''Hocus Pocus''' [4th level spell, action] - transforms the target temporarily into a different creature, following the rules of Polymorph. Unwilling creatures must succeed in a Wisdom saving throw to avoid the transformation.

'''Hocus Pocus Mojocus''' [9th level spell, action] - transforms the target into a different creature or object, following the rules of True Polymorph. If the Witch Doctor keeps full concentration throughout, he can make the transformation permanent.

'''Hoodoo Resurrection''' [7th level spell, ritual] - the Witch Doctor prepares an elaborate and ornate ceremony in order to pull the soul of a dead creature out of the spirit realm, and back into its earthly body, so long as the creature is not undead, did not die of old age, and has not been dead for more than a century. Lost souls can be tricky to find wandering in the spirit world, but so long as it is free and willing, the Witch Doctor can breathe it back into its own body. The target returns to life with full hit points, all its body parts, and is cured of all natural ailments, but does not cleanse magical effects. But resurrection is no small feat, and it takes a toll on both parties: the target takes -4 penalty to all attack rolls, saving throws, and ability checks, reduced by one every long rest. If the target had been dead for more than a year, the Witch Doctor was forced to sacrifice some of his own life force in the ritual, and is left weakened: until he takes a short or long rest, he can no longer cast spells, and has disadvantage on all attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws.

'''Hunga Munga''' [Black Magic, action] - once per short or long rest, the Witch Doctor can use his own life-force to bargain with the darkest spirits from beyond the Veil.  Spending 1 Hit Die, he conjures a wicked black dagger from the spirit realm and viciously rends a foe within striking distance, inflicting 3d10 necrotic damage.  Damage increases by 1d10 for each level of your current max spell level. After the hit, you can continue to spend additional Hit Die to twist the blade, adding each roll individually onto the total damage.

'''Hypnotize''' [5th level spell, action] - the Witch Doctor locks eyes with a humanoid within 60 feet. He begins moving rhythmically, waving his Medicine Stick in a hypnotic pattern and whispering quiet incantations as his otherworldly gaze peers into their very soul. Slowly, the target finds itself falling under his spell. If the creature fails a Wisdom saving throw, it is charmed for the duration of the spell—if the creature is hostile, it has advantage on the roll. While the target is charmed, you can communicate telepathically and issue basic commands without any action, but can issue specific and precise commands on your action. At 6th level slot, duration increases to 10 minutes, at 7th-level slot to one hour, at 8th level to eight hours.

'''Jinx''' [3rd level spell, reaction] - the target is casting a spell 3rd level or below, it is silenced for one round, preventing spell casting until their next turn. If the spell is 4th level or higher, make a Charisma check against a [DC10 + spell level]. On success, the target is silenced for one round. When Jinx is cast using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, targeted spells of equal or lower level are silenced without a Charisma check.

'''Juju Bean''' [3rd level spell, ritual] - the Witch Doctor enchants a magical Juju Bean from his pouch, after which it can be placed, dropped, rolled, or thrown into a desired location. Once in place, the bean acts as a sensor, allowing the Witch Doctor to see and hear whatever the bean ‘sees’ or ‘hears’ from up to a mile away. Unfortunately, the bean is not invisible and is easily destroyed by trampling feet, loose rocks, and enemy weapons. The beans are also a favorite snack of the local wildlife, so proper placement must be considered.

'''Lethal Dose''' [9th level feature, bonus action, reagent required] - the Witch Doctor coats his dart with a lethal dose of poison from a rare poison dart frog. A target struck by this dart takes 1d8 poison damage on its next turn, doubling per round to a maximum of 8d8. When the poison reaches its maximum, the target can make a Constitution save to become immune to the frog poison—if  successful, the effect ends and they become immune to Lethal Dose for the encounter. If the target fails the save, the poison continues to tick at maximum strength for 10 minutes until either a successful saving throw or until it is cleansed.

'''Medicine Man''' [1st level feature] - the Witch Doctor has a natural affinity for healing through natural means, and is double effective when using healing potions, salves, and remedies.

'''Mojo''' [item] - At 3rd level, the Old God bestows a gift upon you for your loyal service. You are given a shrunken head Mojo, emanating powerful black magic and occasionally coming to life to engage in conversation. Mojo himself is quite a chatterbox with an alcohol problem, and his hard head can be used as a 1d4 bludgeon when held in the off-hand. The Witch Doctor’s Mojo acts as a Warlock Tome, allowing the bearer to choose three cantrips from any class’ spell list. While the Mojo is on your person, you can cast those cantrips at will. They do not count against your number of cantrips known. If you lose your Mojo, you can perform a 1-hour voodoo ceremony during a rest to get it back. The Old God will imbue another shrunken head with a worthy spirit to replace the last. The previous Mojo turns to ash.

'''Medium''' [3rd level spell, ritual] - the Witch Doctor becomes a spiritual Medium, able to communicate with spirits from beyond the grave for a short time. Drawing several elaborate symbols on the ground on and around the body, he lights some incense in the corpse's mouth and chants a short incantation, swirling the smoke with his arms. Eyes closed, he places his hand on its forehead, seeming to guide the faint black smoke into his own mouth...and suddenly, his body suddenly gasps a single breath as he breathes it all in. The Witch Doctor's eyes roll back, now glowing with a dim, ethereal glow as he channels the body's spirit through him for a brief period. The spell lasts for 10 minutes, or until your hand is removed.

'''Mesmerize''' [3rd level spell, action] - the Witch Doctor targets a 30x30 foot area within 120 feet, and throws a small vial that shatters on impact, summoning forth a cloud of eerie fog to engulf the area. He begins whispering incantations and waving his Medicine Stick, as if drawing symbols in the air—as he does, faint lights reminiscent of a thousand fireflies slowly appear within the cloud. As the Witch Doctor begins to chant and swaying rhythmically, the lights begin to dance within the cloud, swirling in mystifying patterns. All creatures in the area must succeed at a Wisdom saving throw or become charmed for the duration, and are considered incapacitated unless attacked or shaken out of their trance.

'''Mumbo Jumbo’s Magic Gumbo''' [6th level spell, ritual] - Hands down the best meal in town—just don’t ask what’s in it!  The Witch Doctor prepares a massive, saucy spread of delectable delicacies straight from de bayou. This fiery feast feeds up to twelve, and takes one whole hour to consume—any leftovers are given to Mojo as per his policy. After eating, creatures gain several benefits: they are healed, cured of all diseases and poison, become immune to poison and being frightened, make all Wisdom saving throws with advantage, and maximum hit points increase by 2d10.  These benefits (and any indigestion) last for 24 hours.

'''Mumbo Mambo''' [6th level spell, action] - Who knew the Witch Doctor could drop such a sick beat? Conjuring up a massive tiki drum out of the ground, the Witch Doctor focuses his voodoo energy onto a target within 30 feet and begins beating the drum. The pounding intensifies, faster and more elaborate as the Witch Doctor’s magic works its way into the target’s mind and body…until the target becomes a slave to the rhythm. It begins to dance and sway in place, shuffling and shimmying as the music takes control.  A dancing creature must use all its movement to dance in place, and has a disadvantage on attack rolls and Dexterity saving throws. While dancing, other creatures have advantage on attack rolls against it. A successful Wisdom saving throw breaks the spell. Creatures immune to charm are  unaffected.

'''Nightmare Mind''' [10th level feature] - Starting at 10th level, other beings can no longer enter the terrifying landscape of the Witch Doctor’s mind without your guidance—your thoughts can no longer be read by telepathy or other means unless you allow it. You also have resistance to psychic damage, and whenever a creature deals psychic damage to you, that creature takes the same amount of damage.

'''Ooga Booga''' [3rd level spell, action] - after finding a target, the Witch Doctor throws a small vial onto the ground at his feet, erupting into a cloud of thick, eerie mist. From behind the fog, he takes a deep breath—he exhales with unnatural force, extending his arms toward his target as the cloud billows toward his target, engulfing all creatures in a 30 foot cone. Breathing the mist, all affected creatures feel the hairs on the back of their necks begin to rise, and a sudden and inescapable feeling of panic and dread washes over them. Calling upon some of the darkest corners of the spirit world, the Witch Doctor swirls with voodoo magic, and in the mist, conjures terrifying images of the creatures’ deepest, darkest fears. All targets in the area must make a Wisdom saving throw—if failed, they drop whatever they are holding and become “frightened”. While frightened, creatures must take the Dash action and move as far away from the Witch Doctor as possible on each of its turns. If the creature loses line of sight, it can make another Wisdom saving throw to end the effect.

'''Ouija''' [2nd level spell, ritual] - the Witch Doctor pulls out a large, wooden board with several letters, symbols, and pictures, and attempts to divine information from long-dead voodoo spirits. Using various voodoo paraphernalia, you are able to make contact with these spirits, and can ask them any questions you might have about past, present, or future events...however, expect to typically receive very cryptic answers, as ancient spirits don't always like to make it easy.

'''Paralyzing Dart''' [5th level feature, bonus action, reagent required] - coated with less-common but highly-potent snake venom, the Paralyzing Dart causes 1d6 poison damage on the target’s following turns. The target must make a Constitution save—if failed, the target is paralyzed until it succeeds. Paralyzing Darts stack to a maximum of 6d6, and last for 10 minutes until either a successful saving throw or until it is cleansed.

'''Partial Transformation''' [3rd level feature, bonus action] - At 3rd level, the Witch Doctor's connection to the spirits of nature grants him the ability to alter parts of himself at will. You can choose between several different transformation options, but only one effect can be present at a time. Transforming requires a bonus action, and you can transform a number of times equal to your Witch Doctor level per short or long rest.
*Wolf Head: You can use Bite Attack for 2d6 piercing damage as a bonus action. You also gain advantage on Perception checks involving hearing or scent.
*Frog Tongue: You can elongate your tongue to grab or manipulate objects up to 20 feet away, or simply just to gross people out.
*Jaguar Claws: You are able to make two Claw Attacks for 1d8 slashing damage, but cannot use objects that require hands or cast spells with somatic components.  On a successful hit, the target must succeed at a Constitution Saving Throw or suffer 1d4 bleed damage at the start of their next turn. Bleed damage stacks.
*Crocodile Hide: You harden your skin into thick, leathery pleats, giving you resistance to your choice of Piercing, Slashing, or Bludgeoning damage for the duration.
*Serpent Body: Alter your lower half to resemble an anaconda. Your movement speed is halved for the duration, but you gain Advantage on Grapple checks and allows the free use of your hands and arms.
*Bat Wings: Sprout two large wings from your back, granting you immunity to falling damage and allowing you to Glide at a speed of 60 feet, descending 5 feet per round.

'''Pins and Needles''' [bonus action] - the Witch Doctor inserts a needle into the voodoo doll, causing excruciating pain and dealing 1d4 internal damage to the target of the Voodoo Curse every round until the bond is broken. If the target is under the effects of Voodoo Boon, a pin is used instead to do 1d4 healing every round until the bond is broken. The total number of pins or needles a Witch Doctor can utilize is equal to his character level. If the voodoo bond is broken, or if the Witch Doctor changes targets, the effects end and the pins and needles must be removed before the next attempt. Additional effects depend on the placement of the needle:
*Head: Hostile target must succeed at a Constitution saving throw or become blinded.  Friendly target is cured of Blindness and gains Blindsight.
*Arms: Hostile target must succeed at a Constitution saving throw or subtract the needles' damage from their physical attack damage. Friendly target adds the needles' damage.
*Legs: Hostile target must succeed at a Constitution saving throw or reduce their movement speed by half—with two needles active in the legs at the same time, the target becomes immobilized. *Friendly target is cured of movement-impairment and their movement speed increases by half with one needle, and doubles with two needles.

'''Poison Dart''' [1st level feature, bonus action, reagent required] - coated with common but painful insect venom, the Poison Dart causes 1d4 poison damage on its following turns. Poison Darts stack to a maximum of 4d4, and last 10 minutes unless cleansed.

'''Possession''' [6th level feature] - At 11th level, the Old God bestows upon you another gift—the gift of Possession. You are able to absorb the spirit of another long-dead Witch Doctor, gaining the permanent ability to channel that spirit in order to tap into its power. Choose a 6th-level spell from the Witch Doctor spell list as your Possession spells. Once per long rest, you can call upon that spirit to Possess you for a short time, enabling you to cast that spell without expending a spell slot. At higher levels, you are able to absorb additional and more powerful voodoo spirits, allowing you to gain more Possession spells: one 7th-level spell at 13th level, one 8th-level spell at 15th level, and one 9th-level spell at 17th level. You regain all Possession spells when you finish a short or long rest.

'''Primal Hex''' [3rd level spell, bonus action] – The Witch Doctor rattles some ancient bones in the direction of his target, causing nearby shadows to begin wrapping around them like faint black smoke. The target  receives an extra 1d8 necrotic damage from all of Witch Doctor’s damaging attacks and spells for the duration unless it is removed by Remove Curse. If you use a spell slot of 5rd  level or higher, the duration increases to 8 hours. If the target dies while under the effects, you may use a bonus action to transfer Primal Hex to another target.

'''Primal Savagery''' [6th level feature, passive] - At 6th level, your transformation weapons are considered “Magical” for combat purposes of overcoming resistances and immunity to nonmagical damage, and you can attack twice whenever you choose the “Attack” Action.

'''Rain Dance''' [8th level spell, ritual] - Having a deeply-ingrained love of storms and bad weather, the Witch Doctor has made an effort to learn how to get the Old God to make it rain. And when the Old God makes it rain, he makes it pour. The Witch Doctor begins a bizarre ritual dance, accompanied by shaking sticks and loud, off-key chanting. After 10 minutes of this, the Old God gives in, and begins to alter the weather for its Witch Doctor. It takes  1d4 x 10 minutes for the desired Precipitation and Wind conditions to take effect, and they last up to 8 hours—climate is not affected, but other changes linger after concentration is broken.

'''Rejuvenating Dart''' [1st level feature, bonus action, reagent required] - coated with a mild herbal pain reliever, it is shot into a friendly target to heal them 1d4 on the target’s following turns. Dart healing stacks to a maximum of 8d4, and lasts 10 minutes unless it is dispelled.

'''Shamanism''' [4th level spell, action] - the Witch Doctor communes with the spirit of a targeted beast, and if it fails a Wisdom saving throw, he is able to dominate its mind. If in combat with the creature, it has advantage on the roll.

'''Shaman King''' [14th level feature] - At 14th level, you have become a true master of the wilds, effortlessly interacting with the natural world and altering your own physicality, and have gained enhancements to your transformations:
*Wolf Head:  You gain the ability “Howl” once per short or long rest, which summons a pack of up to 1d4 wolves that remain for up to 1 hour.
*Frog Tongue: Your tongue's reach is now 30 feet, and can be used to Disarm a target should they fail a Strength check.
*Jaguar Claws: You are now dextrous enough with your claws to grasp objects and cast spells with somatic components.
*Crocodile Hide: Your hide is tougher now, and grants you resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.
*Serpent Body: While successfully grappling an opponent with your tail, you can Constrict the target for 1d8 bludgeoning damage as a Bonus Action once per round.
*Bat Wings: Your wings are now able to properly carry your weight, allowing you to Fly with at a speed of 60 feet per round.

'''Shifting Adept''' [10th level feature] - At 10th level, the Witch Doctor has become so proficient at his partial transformations that he is able to maintain two at a time. Additionally, you can cast Skinwalker once per long rest without consuming a spell slot or material cost.

'''Shrunken Heads''' [1st level feat, bonus action, reagents required] - the Witch Doctor also has a penchant for head hunting, collecting the heads of humanoid victims and shrinking them with the assistance of voodoo and hoodoo magic over the course of a long rest. They are often used as means of dispersing the Witch Doctor's poisons over a small area, filled with 10 doses of the specified poison and covering a 20 foot radius—but they can have many other creative uses.

'''Skinwalker''' [9th level spell, action] - the Witch Doctor is feared for many reasons, but perhaps one of the most terrifying is his ability to take the physical form of his victims. A powerful ‘Soul Drinker’, the Witch Doctor absorbs the spirits of the creatures he kills, granting him their knowledge, their energy, and the ability to transform his own form into their image. He can only shape shift into creatures with a challenge rating equal to or lower than his level, and only creatures he has killed, but can do so without material components.

'''Soul Drinker''' [2nd level feature] - Starting at 2nd level, the Witch Doctor learns how to literally devour the soul of a fallen enemy, using it to fuel his own vitality.  When you reduce a hostile creature to 0 hit points with a killing blow, or when the target of your Voodoo Curse is reduced to 0 hit points, you regain hit points equal to your Charisma modifier + your Witch Doctor level (minimum of 1). If you are already at full health, the additional healing is converted into Temporary Hit Points.

'''Spew Poison''' [1st level spell, action] - the Witch Doctor pulls out a small vial from his pouch containing a black potion swirling with faint traces of green. He pulls out the stopper and drinks it down, wiping his mouth before finding his target. He braces himself in a sturdy stance, and after a few moments, lurches forward and opens his mouth—a massive stream of now-entirely-green poison blasts toward the victim with astonishing force. If the Witch doctor succeeds at a ranged spell attack, the target takes 2d8 poison damage and must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it is also poisoned until the end of your next turn. The damage increases by 1d8 per slot level.

'''Spirit Animal''' [Bargain with Primal Spirits, Black Magic] - The Witch Doctor is able to choose his Spirit Animal to be his permanent companion. The creature must be a naturally-occurring beast, and have a Challenge Rating equal to or lower than 1/3 of your Witch Doctor level, rounded up. As a Bonus Action, you can also command your Spirit Animal to merge with you for up to 10 minutes, allowing you to replace any of your Ability Scores with those of your companion, and giving you both the abilities and appearance aspects of your Spirit Animal. Due to the taxing nature of merging spirits, you are only able to perform this merger once per long rest.

'''Spooky Action''' [5th level spell, action] - the Witch Doctor commands a powerful, unseen force to manipulate physical objects or even creatures at his whim. Spooky Action follows the same rule set as “Telekinesis”.

'''Stirring of an Old God''' [9th level spell, action] - in the most dire of times, the Witch Doctor falls to his knees and raises his hands to the sky, crying out in desperation as he attempts to wake his Old God. And somewhere, beyond the fabric of space and time…his Old God hears him.  The world seems to twist in its mere presence, black clouds churn above like the raging sea as streaks of jagged, green lightning rip across the swirling sky. Wind whips and howls in furious gales, with thunder so deafening it seems to shake the very earth…and so you begin to witness the stirring of an Old God:
	*Round 1: Each creature within the 360 foot spell radius must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 2d6 thunder damage and becomes deafened for 5 minutes.
	*Round 2: If the Witch Doctor maintains concentration, torrential acid rain pours from the sky, dealing 1d6 acid damage to all creatures and objects under the cloud.
	*Round 3: If the Witch Doctor maintains concentration, he looks to the Old God and calls down six bolts of lightning to strike six creatures or objects. If a creature fails a Dexterity saving throw, it takes 10d6 lightning damage. If it succeeds, it takes 5d6. No creature or object can be struck more than once.
	*Round 4: If the Witch Doctor maintains concentration, heavy shards of brimstone rain down from above. Each creature takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage.
	*Round 5-10: If the Witch Doctor maintains concentration, tempest winds and frigid rain cause the area to become obscured, and it is considered ‘difficult terrain’. Range weapon attacks are impossible, fogs or mists are dispersed, and the torrent acts as a ‘severe distraction’ for concentration. All creatures take 1d6 cold damage.

'''Supa Dupa Healin’ Hoodoo''' [5th level spell, action] - the Witch Doctor doesn’t like when his friends all seem to be bleeding—with a fervor bordering on frenzy, he begins madly combining various hoodoo healing herbs, draughts, and powders into as many as six small glass tinctures. With terrifying speed, the Witch Doctor seems to slow time itself as he wildly pitches each tincture at the head of an ally within a 30 foot area of his target. The miraculous part is that he never, ever misses. Each affected target is healed for 3d8 + your Charisma modifier.  Healing increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 5th.

'''Talking Head''' [Black Magic, passive effect] - Two heads are better than one, they say!  Aside from being both a drunk and a chatterbox, it turns out the Witch Doctor’s Mojo also has a surprisingly keen memory—particularly for magic. You can now put your Mojo to work memorizing any manner of magical rituals you happen to come across in your adventures, so long as they are less than or equal to half your Witch Doctor level (rounded up). It takes two hours per spell level of rigorous repetition to permanently pound a new ritual into Mojo’s tiny head, as well as 50gp for the necessary alcohol required to bribe him into cooperating. Choose two 1st-level spells with the ritual tag from any spell list: those rituals—and any you are able to teach Mojo down the road— are permanently castable, without taking up a spell slot or a ‘spells known’ slot.

'''That Voodoo That You Do''' [Black Magic, passive effect] - Nobody do dat voodoo like you do! When casting Voodoo Bolt, add your Charisma modifier to the damage roll.

'''Totemic Might''' [10th level feature] - At 10th level, the Witch Doctor's physicality is imbued with the power of the Ancestral Guardians themselves. You gain advantage on Strength Checks and Saving Throws, and your Ancestral Spear deals extra damage equal to your Charisma modifier.

'''Trance''' [Black Magic, 15th level or higher, action] - as an Action once per short or long rest, the Witch Doctor’s arms raise, his eyes roll back, and he falls into an otherworldly trance. While entranced, becomes a conduit of voodoo magic, a vessel of pulsating dark energy.  Until his next turn, he gains advantage to all saving throws, but is unable to make any additional movement, action, or bonus action.  On the following turn, the Witch Doctor comes out of his trance empowered by ancient spirits—he has advantage on Attack rolls, and his next successful damaging or healing ability deals double damage or healing. The effect fades at the end of the turn of your next successful ability. If the Witch Doctor’s concentration is broken during the trance, then the turn is wasted and he must fall back into the trance again.

'''Tribal Tenacity''' [6th level feature] - At 6th level, the Witch Doctor has become even more adept with his Ancestral Spear, allowing him to attack twice instead of once whenever he chooses the Attack action on one of his turns. Additionally, you are able to add your Strength modifier to your spell damage or healing.

'''Voodoo Bolt''' [cantrip, action] - the Witch Doctor focuses his voodoo magic into his palm and blasts it at a target, unleashing a bolt of crackling dark energy from his hand. On a successful ranged spell attack, the blast hits the target with tremendous force, causing 1d10 force damage. At higher levels, the spell creates additional bolts: two bolts at 5th level, three bolts at 11th level, and four bolts at 17th level. All bolts have separate attack rolls.

'''Voodoo Boon''' [Black Magic, action] - A friendly target willingly accepts a voodoo link with the doll, and gains advantage to Attack Rolls and Saving throws for up to 1 hour or until the link is broken. The target is also able to receive any healing done to the doll regardless of their proximity. If the doll is made with a personal ingredient (blood, hair, fingernail, etc.) from the target, the spell no longer requires Concentration and lasts for 1 hour unless broken.

'''Voodoo Curse''' [Black Magic, action] - a hostile target must make a Wisdom saving throw, with disadvantage if the doll contains an element of the target that the Witch Doctor has obtained. If target fails, they succumb to the Voodoo Curse: they have disadvantage on action rolls and saving throws, and suffer internal damage from attacks made against the doll regardless of their proximity. The target can continue making Wisdom saving throws (with disadvantage) at the start of every turn in order to break the curse.

'''Voodoo Doll''' [item] - a created reagent that acts as a catalyst for “Voodoo Curse” and “Voodoo Boon”. Can be used to respectively harm or heal. Actions done to the doll are done to the target, and the doll reflects the state of the target. If the doll is adorned with an element obtained from the target (hair, blood, clothing, fingernail, etc.), the Witch Doctor has advantage on doll-focused actions. If the voodoo link is broken, the Witch Doctor must reestablish the connection. You can craft a voodoo doll over the course of one action, or prepare a crafted one with additional elements as a bonus action.

'''Voodoo Guru''' [20th level feature] - At 20th level, the Old God creates a permanent and direct link between itself and the Witch Doctor. Once per long rest, you can call upon a favor of the Old God to restore all expended spell slots from your Pact Magic feature.

'''Voodoo Servant''' [1st level spell, ritual] - the Witch Doctor begins a voodoo ritual, pulling a lesser voodoo spirit into the mortal realm from beyond the veil. Once on the physical plane, the spirit becomes the Witch Doctor’s unseen servant for one hour. The servant must remain within 60 feet of you at all times, or its connection to the world is broken.

'''Voodoo Vestments''' [item] - the Tiki Mask given to the Witch Doctor by the Old God, tokens of affection that are imbued with voodoo magic. These vestments act as arcane foci.

'''Whisperer''' [2nd level feature] - At 2nd level, the Witch Doctor learns commune with the spirits of nature, able to speak with and understand them as if they could speak, themselves. You gain Advantage on all Nature and Animal Handling checks, and can cast Speak with Animals at will, without a spell slot or material cost.

'''Wicked Wanga''' [cantrip, bonus action] - the Witch Doctor’s Medicine Stick is empowered with hoodoo magic, and uses Charisma instead of Strength for attack and damage rolls. It is also considered ‘magical’ with a d8 damage die.
