				<name>Phantom Calling: Calling of the Poltergeist</name>
				<text>Those souls who wish to still exert their will on the physical world, shifting steel and flesh with their anger alone, begin walking the way of the Poltergeist. Abandoning subtlety to instead harness a maelstrom of unbridled emotion. the Poltergeist exhibits the ability to lift, push, and manipulate the substantial realm around them. The clattering of dangerous weapons and helpless attackers being invisibly flung through the air mercilessly marks the fury of these ferocious shades.</text>
				<text>	Upon becoming a Poltergeist, choose either your Strength, Dexterity or Intelligence to become your Aspect. Your Aspect modifier is equal to that of the chosen Ability Score. You gain proficiency in Strength saving throws.</text>

On a hit, the target takes 1d4 + your Aspect modifier bludgeoning damage, and the object drops to the ground. If the object is a weapon you are proficient in, use the weapon's damage dice and type instead. Any magical weapons you are proficient with and attuned to can be used with this feature.</text>
