			<text>You have free access to movers and shakers with whom your patron organization has connections. You can petition for and usually receive an audience from a noble, guild head, or crime lord, provided they are amenable to the group you represent. While you are on official business, your host will usually provide you with accommodations, sustenance, and entertainment, provided you remain on good terms.

		<trait>
			<name>Feature: Echoes of Another Life</name>
			<text>As one of the reborn, you have an entire previous life's worth of memories and experiences to draw on, and sometimes you come across people or places you recognize from that past life. When you select this background, choose a single organization that is relatively widespread; for example, you might choose the religious orders of a faith from your past, the military forces of a kingdom, an order of monks, or the cabal of cultists that once served you. In your past life, you had a strong relationship with that organizationâ€”whether friendly or antagonistic, as you choose when you select this background. You have a strong familiarity with the traditions, practices, hierarchies, and trappings of that organization, enough so that you can convincingly converse with a member of that organization and pass yourself off as a member. You can draw upon your knowledge of that organization at will.

			<name>Feature: Military Rank</name>
			<text>You have a military rank from your career as a soldier. Soldiers loyal to your former military organization still recognize your authority and influence, and they defer to you if they are of a lower rank. You can invoke your rank to exert influence over other soldiers and requisition simple equipment or horses for temporary use. You can also usually gain access to friendly military encampments and fortresses where your rank is recognized.</text>
