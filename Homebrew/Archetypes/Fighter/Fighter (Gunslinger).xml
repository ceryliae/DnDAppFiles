				<name>Martial Archetype: Gunslinger</name>
				<text>Most warriors and combat specialists spend their years perfecting the classic arts of swordplay, archery, or polearm tactics. Whether duelist or infantry, martial weapons were seemingly perfected long ago, and the true challenge is to master them.</text>
				<text>	However, some minds couldn't stop with the innovation of the crossbow. Experimentation with alchemical components and rare metals have unlocked the secrets of controlled explosive force. The few who survive these trials of ingenuity may become the first to create, and deftly wield, the first firearms.</text>
				<text>	This archetype focuses on the ability to design, craft, and utilize powerful, yet dangerous ranged weapons. Through creative innovation and immaculate aim, you become a distant force of death on the battlefield. However, not being a perfect science, firearms carry an inherent instability that can occasionally leave you without a functional means of attack. This is the danger of new, untested technologies in a world where the arcane energies that rule the elements are ever present.</text>
				<text>	Should this path of powder, fire, and metal call to you, keep your wits about you, hold on to your convictions as a fighter, and let skill meet luck to guide your bullets to strike true.</text>
			</feature>
			<feature optional="YES">
				<name>Gunslinger: Firearm Proficiency</name>
				<text>Starting when you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with firearms, allowing you to add your proficiency bonus to attacks made with firearms.</text>
			</feature>
			<feature optional="YES">
				<name>Gunslinger: Gunsmith</name>
				<text>Upon choosing this archetype at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with Tinker's Tools. You may use them to craft ammunition at half the cost, repair damaged firearms, or even draft and create new ones (DM's discretion). Some extremely experimental and intricate firearms are only available through crafting.</text>
			</feature>
			<feature optional="YES">
				<name>Gunslinger: Firearm Properties</name>
				<text>Reload: The weapon can be fired a number of times equal to its Reload number before the wielder must spend 1 Attack of your Attack Action, or an Action, to reload. You must have one free hand to reload a firearm.</text>
				<text>Misfire: Whenever the Firearm is fired in a way that requires an Attack Roll, if the dice roll is equal to or lower than the Misfire number, the weapon Misfires, the attack misses, and it cannot be used to attack again until an Action and successful Tinker's Tools Ability Check (DC = 10 + Firearm's Misfire Score) is used to repair and clear the weapon. Should the Tinker's Tools check fail, the weapon is considered broken and must be repaired out of combat at half the cost of the weapon (or DM's discretion).</text>
				<text>Scatter: An attack is made against each creature within a 30 ft cone. If an affected creature is adjacent to you, they suffer double damage on a hit.</text>
				<text>Explosive: Upon a hit, everything within 5 ft of the target must make a Dexterity saving throw or suffer half damage. If the weapon misses, the ammunition fails to detonate, or bounces away harmlessly before doing so.</text>
			</feature>
			<feature optional="YES">
				<name>Gunslinger: Ammunition</name>
				<text>All firearms require ammunition to make an attack, and due to their rare nature, ammunition may be near impossible to find or purchase. However, if materials are gathered, you can craft ammunition yourself using your Tinker’s Tools at half the cost. Each firearm uses its own unique ammunition and is generally sold or crafted in batches listed below next to the price.</text>

			<feature optional="YES">
				<name>Gunslinger: Adept Marksman</name>
				<text>When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you learn to perform powerful trick shots to disable or damage your opponents using your firearms.</text>
				<text/>
				<text>Trick Shots. You learn two trick shots of your choice, which are detailed under "Trick Shots" below. Many maneuvers enhance an attack in some way. Each use of a trick shot must be declared before the attack roll is made. You can use only one trick shot per attack.</text>
				<text/>
				<text>You learn an additional trick shot of your choice at 7th, 10th, 15th, and 18th level. Each time you learn a new trick shot, you can also replace one trick shot you know with a different one.</text>
				<text/>
				<name>Gunslinger: Grit</name>
				<text>You gain a number of grit points equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of 1). You regain 1 expended grit point each time you roll a 20 on the d20 roll for an attack with a firearm, or deal a killing blow with a firearm to a creature of significant threat (DM’s discretion). You regain all expended grit points after a short or long rest.</text>
				<text/>
				<text>Saving Throws. Some of your trick shots require your targets to make a saving throw to resist the trick shot’s effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:
					<text>	Trick Shot save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Dexterity modifier</text>
