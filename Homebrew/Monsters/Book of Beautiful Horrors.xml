			<text>After the botchling uses its Wail, there is a 50 percent chance that it will summon 1d3 specters or one shade. A summoned creature materializes within 30 feet of the botchling in an unoccupied space. The creature acts as an ally of the botchling. The creature vanishes when it drops to 0 hit points.</text>

		<action>
			<name>Influence</name>
			<text>The myling targets one humanoid it can see within 30 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw against this magic or be charmed by the myling. The charmed target regards the myling as a trusted friend to be heeded and protected. Although the target isn't under the myling's control, it takes the myling's requests or actions in the most favorable way it can. Each time the myling or the myling's companions do anything harmful to the target, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success. Otherwise, the effect lasts 24 hours or until the myling is destroyed, is on a different plane of existence than the target, or takes a bonus action to end the effect.</text>
		</action>
		<action>
			<name>Possession (Recharge 5-6)</name>
			<text>One child humanoid that the myling can see within 5 feet of it must succeed on a DC 16 Charisma saving throw or be possessed by the myling; the myling then disappears, and the target is incapacitated and loses control of its body.</text>
			<text>The myling now controls the body but doesn't deprive the target of awareness. The myling can't be targeted by any attack, spell, or other effect, except ones that turn undead, and it retains its alignment, Intelligence,</text>
			<text>Wisdom, Charisma, and immunity to being charmed. It otherwise uses the possessed target's statistics, but doesn't gain access to the target's knowledge, class features, or proficiencies.</text>
			<text>The possession lasts until the body drops to 0 hit points, the myling ends it as a bonus action, or the myling is turned or forced out by an effect like the dispel evil and good spell. When the possession ends, the myling reappears in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the body. The target is immune to this myling's Possession for 24 hours after succeeding on the saving throw or after the possession ends.</text>
