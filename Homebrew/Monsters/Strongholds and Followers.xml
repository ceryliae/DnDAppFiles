		<name>Psionics</name>
<text>The gemstone dragons are silico-organic organisms. When hatched, they are almost entirely organic. As they grow, their crystalline structure grows, as does their psionic power.</text>
<text>The crystals that grow on and thread through their bodies form a network of psionic filaments that capture, conduct, amplify, and store charges of psionic energies, which the dragons then convert into manifestations.</text>
<text>Each dragon begins with a number of charges based on their age. They can expend these charges to cast any psionic manifestation. Many of these manifestations have a base cost and can be enhanced by expending more charges.</text>
<text>Over time, the dragon’s crystals conduct more psionic energies into its body, recharging its power. At the end of each round, roll the recharge die and restore that many charges.</text>
<text>Each dragon also has a fracture rating. Each time it takes more damage than its fracture rating from a single attack, its crystalline form fractures, diminishing its ability to recharge its power. Roll the recharge die and reduce the dragon’s total charges by the result. This damage heals itself upon finishing a long rest.</text>

<text>Psionic charges are used to manifest psionic abilities. These manifestations are the primary source of a gemstone dragon’s power. All manifestations have a range of 30 feet, unless noted otherwise.</text>
<text>The following manifestations are by no means the only ones the dragons have access to. It is known that the most powerful gemstone dragons can alter their form at will in a manner that defies all inspection. But these are the most well-documented and commonly used manifestations available to all psionic creatures.</text>

    <trait>
        <name>Psionics</name>
<text>The gemstone dragons are silico-organic organisms. When hatched, they are almost entirely organic. As they grow, their crystalline structure grows, as does their psionic power.</text>
<text>The crystals that grow on and thread through their bodies form a network of psionic filaments that capture, conduct, amplify, and store charges of psionic energies, which the dragons then convert into manifestations.</text>
<text>Each dragon begins with a number of charges based on their age. They can expend these charges to cast any psionic manifestation. Many of these manifestations have a base cost and can be enhanced by expending more charges.</text>
<text>Over time, the dragon’s crystals conduct more psionic energies into its body, recharging its power. At the end of each round, roll the recharge die and restore that many charges.</text>
<text>Each dragon also has a fracture rating. Each time it takes more damage than its fracture rating from a single attack, its crystalline form fractures, diminishing its ability to recharge its power. Roll the recharge die and reduce the dragon’s total charges by the result. This damage heals itself upon finishing a long rest.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait>
        <name>Manifestations</name>
<text>Psionic charges are used to manifest psionic abilities. These manifestations are the primary source of a gemstone dragon’s power. All manifestations have a range of 30 feet, unless noted otherwise.</text>
<text>The following manifestations are by no means the only ones the dragons have access to. It is known that the most powerful gemstone dragons can alter their form at will in a manner that defies all inspection. But these are the most well-documented and commonly used manifestations available to all psionic creatures.</text>

<text>Amplify</text>
<text>Casting Time: 1 action</text>
<text>Duration: 1 round</text>
<text>Range: Self</text>
<text>Charges: 4</text>
<text>The dragon focuses the power of its mind and wreaths its teeth, claws, and tail in glowing psionic force. For the next minute, all of its melee attacks deal an extra 3d8 psychic damage.</text>

<text>  Target two enemies. Both must succeed on an Intelligence saving throw or else swap character sheets until they take a short rest.</text>

<text>Believe</text>
<text>Casting Time: 1 action</text>
<text>Duration: 1 round</text>
<text>Range: 60 ft</text>
<text>Charges: 10</text>
<text>Target one creature. The dragon infects the mind of the target with a new belief. The target must succeed on an Intelligence saving throw or suffer an effect chosen from the list below.</text>
<text>  Friends: Until the end of its next turn, the target will not attack enemy combatants, and enemies have advantage on their next attack against this target.</text>
<text>  Enemies: On its next action, the target will move to the closest ally and attack it.</text>
<text>  Chasm: The target perceives a chasm opening up beneath it. It falls prone and takes 1d8 psychic damage. This belief persists—at the start of each round, the target makes an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, it continues feeling as though it is falling into an infinite abyss, taking 1d8 psychic damage.</text>
<text>  Wonder: The target spends a round doing nothing.</text>
<text>  Disaster: The target feels the world is ending and flees for one round.</text>

<text>Elsewhere</text>
<text>Casting Time: 1 action</text>
<text>Duration: Instantaneous</text>
<text>Range: 30 ft</text>
<text>Charges: 2 per feet</text>
<text>Pick a target within 30 feet. The target must succeed on an Intelligence saving throw or be teleported 5 feet per 2 charges spent. The destination must be within sight of the dragon and not currently occupied.</text>
<text></text>
<text>Flay</text>
<text>Casting Time: 1 bonus action</text>
<text>Duration: 1 round</text>
<text>Range: Self (60-foot cone)</text>
<text>Charges: 2 per d6 of damage</text>
<text>As a bonus action, the dragon blasts pure psionic energy from its eyes, frying the brains of all creatures in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, it takes psychic damage of a d6 per 2 charges spent, or half as much damage on a successful one.</text>
<text></text>
<text>Foget</text>
<text>Casting Time: 1 action</text>
<text>Duration: Special</text>
<text>Range: 60 ft</text>
<text>Charges: 5 + 1 per spell level if a spell is chosen</text>
<text>The dragon reaches into an enemy’s mind and plucks a critical memory from their cortex, either the knowledge of a spell or of a weapon. This effect lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The dragon can only use this manifestation once every ten minutes on the same target. Saving against the manifestation means the target is immune to Forget for 24 hours.</text>
<text>  Spells: Pick a target and choose a spell the target knows. Spend charges equal in number to 5 plus the spell level. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target cannot cast that spell until the effect of this manifestation ends.</text>
<text>  Weapons: Pick a target and choose a weapon. Spend 3 extra charges. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target does not gain the benefit of their proficiency bonus with the chosen kind of weapon while the effect lasts. (For example, they might forget how to use a longsword, but still gain their proficiency benefit with shortswords.)</text>
<text></text>
<text>Mindscape</text>
<text>Casting Time: 1 action</text>
<text>Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute</text>
<text>Range: 30 ft</text>
<text>Charges: 3 + 1 charge per round</text>
<text>The dragon implants a vision of a new landscape in the target’s mind, making them blind to their actual surroundings, causing them to move randomly and erratically. Choose a target to make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, this manifestation becomes active. If the target chooses to move while the manifestation is active, it moves 10 feet in a random direction (roll 1d8) instead of the distance and direc- tion it intended.</text>
<text></text>
<text>The Real</text>
<text>Casting Time: 1 action</text>
<text>Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour</text>
<text>Range: Self</text>
<text>Charges: 4</text>
<text>The dragon sees the real reality. It can tell what is an illusion, and it sees invisible creatures and creatures hidden or disguised by magic. Magical darkness does not affect it, and it can see into the Ethereal Plane.</text>
<text></text>
<text>Reflection</text>
<text>Casting Time: 1 action</text>
<text>Duration: 1 minute</text>
<text>Range: Self</text>
<text>Charges: 10 + reflection rank</text>
<text>The dragon reaches through time and plucks an ally from the timescape to come and fight alongside it. Choose a row from the Servitors chart. The cost of manifesting a reflection is 10 charges plus the type of the summoned creature on the table. (For example, summoning the Inexorable of Nature costs 16 charges: 10 plus the Inexorable’s type of 6.)</text>
<text></text>
<text>Sympathy</text>
<text>Casting Time: 1 reaction</text>
<text>Duration: Instantaneous</text>
<text>Range: 30 ft</text>
<text>Charges: 2 charges per d8</text>
<text>The dragon violently reacts to being hurt, raking its enemy’s nervous system with sympathetic psionic vibrations.</text>
<text>  As a reaction to taking damage from something the dragon can see within 30 feet, the dragon expends charges to force the damaging creature to make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 1d8 psychic damage per 2 charges spent. The maximum damage this can deal equals the damage dealt to the dragon that prompted this manifestation.</text>
<text></text>
<text>Weight</text>
<text>Casting Time: 1 reaction</text>
<text>Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute</text>
<text>Range: 30 ft</text>
<text>Charges: 3 + 1 charge per round</text>
<text>The gemstone dragons know that the weave of the timescape isn’t a true force—it’s little more than a quirk of geometry. One they can enhance or reverse at their discretion.</text>
<text>  Choose a target within range and select either Levitas or Gravitas. The target must succeed on an Intelligence saving throw or suffer the effect described below.</text>
<text>  Levitas: The target rises 10 feet per round. A levitating target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, until they save. When the target eventually hits the ground, it takes 1d6 damage per 10 feet fallen, with the maximum dice equal to their level (e.g., 5d6 for level 5).</text>
<text>  Gravitas: The target’s movement is reduced to 10 feet.</text>

		<name>Psionics</name>
<text>The gemstone dragons are silico-organic organisms. When hatched, they are almost entirely organic. As they grow, their crystalline structure grows, as does their psionic power.</text>
<text>The crystals that grow on and thread through their bodies form a network of psionic filaments that capture, conduct, amplify, and store charges of psionic energies, which the dragons then convert into manifestations.</text>
<text>Each dragon begins with a number of charges based on their age. They can expend these charges to cast any psionic manifestation. Many of these manifestations have a base cost and can be enhanced by expending more charges.</text>
<text>Over time, the dragon’s crystals conduct more psionic energies into its body, recharging its power. At the end of each round, roll the recharge die and restore that many charges.</text>
<text>Each dragon also has a fracture rating. Each time it takes more damage than its fracture rating from a single attack, its crystalline form fractures, diminishing its ability to recharge its power. Roll the recharge die and reduce the dragon’s total charges by the result. This damage heals itself upon finishing a long rest.</text>

		<name>Manifestations</name>
<text>Psionic charges are used to manifest psionic abilities. These manifestations are the primary source of a gemstone dragon’s power. All manifestations have a range of 30 feet, unless noted otherwise.</text>
<text>The following manifestations are by no means the only ones the dragons have access to. It is known that the most powerful gemstone dragons can alter their form at will in a manner that defies all inspection. But these are the most well-documented and commonly used manifestations available to all psionic creatures.</text>

<text>Target one creature. The dragon infects the mind of the target with a new belief. The target must succeed on an Intelligence saving throw or suffer an effect chosen from the list below.</text>
<text>	Friends: Until the end of its next turn, the target will not attack enemy combatants, and enemies have advantage on their next attack against this target.</text>
<text>	Enemies: On its next action, the target will move to the closest ally and attack it.</text>
<text>	Chasm: The target perceives a chasm opening up beneath it. It falls prone and takes 1d8 psychic damage. This belief persists—at the start of each round, the target makes an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, it continues feeling as though it is falling into an infinite abyss, taking 1d8 psychic damage.</text>
<text>	Wonder: The target spends a round doing nothing.</text>

<text>As a bonus action, the dragon blasts pure psionic energy from its eyes, frying the brains of all creatures in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, it takes psychic damage of a d6 per 2 charges spent, or half as much damage on a successful one.</text>

<text>Duration: Special</text>

<text>Charges: 5 + 1 per spell level if a spell is chosen</text>
<text>The dragon reaches into an enemy’s mind and plucks a critical memory from their cortex, either the knowledge of a spell or of a weapon. This effect lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The dragon can only use this manifestation once every ten minutes on the same target. Saving against the manifestation means the target is immune to Forget for 24 hours.</text>
<text>	Spells: Pick a target and choose a spell the target knows. Spend charges equal in number to 5 plus the spell level. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target cannot cast that spell until the effect of this manifestation ends.</text>
<text>	Weapons: Pick a target and choose a weapon. Spend 3 extra charges. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target does not gain the benefit of their proficiency bonus with the chosen kind of weapon while the effect lasts. (For example, they might forget how to use a longsword, but still gain their proficiency benefit with shortswords.)</text>

<text>Charges: 3 + 1 charge per round</text>
<text>The dragon implants a vision of a new landscape in the target’s mind, making them blind to their actual surroundings, causing them to move randomly and erratically. Choose a target to make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, this manifestation becomes active. If the target chooses to move while the manifestation is active, it moves 10 feet in a random direction (roll 1d8) instead of the distance and direc- tion it intended.</text>

<text>Charges: 10 + reflection rank</text>
<text>The dragon reaches through time and plucks an ally from the timescape to come and fight alongside it. Choose a row from the Servitors chart. The cost of manifesting a reflection is 10 charges plus the type of the summoned creature on the table. (For example, summoning the Inexorable of Nature costs 16 charges: 10 plus the Inexorable’s type of 6.)</text>

<text>The dragon violently reacts to being hurt, raking its enemy’s nervous system with sympathetic psionic vibrations.</text>
<text>	As a reaction to taking damage from something the dragon can see within 30 feet, the dragon expends charges to force the damaging creature to make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 1d8 psychic damage per 2 charges spent. The maximum damage this can deal equals the damage dealt to the dragon that prompted this manifestation.</text>

<text>The gemstone dragons know that the weave of the timescape isn’t a true force—it’s little more than a quirk of geometry. One they can enhance or reverse at their discretion.</text>
<text>	Choose a target within range and select either Levitas or Gravitas. The target must succeed on an Intelligence saving throw or suffer the effect described below.</text>
<text>	Levitas: The target rises 10 feet per round. A levitating target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, until they save. When the target eventually hits the ground, it takes 1d6 damage per 10 feet fallen, with the maximum dice equal to their level (e.g., 5d6 for level 5).</text>

    <trait>
        <name>Psionics</name>
<text>The gemstone dragons are silico-organic organisms. When hatched, they are almost entirely organic. As they grow, their crystalline structure grows, as does their psionic power.</text>
<text>The crystals that grow on and thread through their bodies form a network of psionic filaments that capture, conduct, amplify, and store charges of psionic energies, which the dragons then convert into manifestations.</text>
<text>Each dragon begins with a number of charges based on their age. They can expend these charges to cast any psionic manifestation. Many of these manifestations have a base cost and can be enhanced by expending more charges.</text>
<text>Over time, the dragon’s crystals conduct more psionic energies into its body, recharging its power. At the end of each round, roll the recharge die and restore that many charges.</text>
<text>Each dragon also has a fracture rating. Each time it takes more damage than its fracture rating from a single attack, its crystalline form fractures, diminishing its ability to recharge its power. Roll the recharge die and reduce the dragon’s total charges by the result. This damage heals itself upon finishing a long rest.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait>
        <name>Manifestations</name>
<text>Psionic charges are used to manifest psionic abilities. These manifestations are the primary source of a gemstone dragon’s power. All manifestations have a range of 30 feet, unless noted otherwise.</text>
<text>The following manifestations are by no means the only ones the dragons have access to. It is known that the most powerful gemstone dragons can alter their form at will in a manner that defies all inspection. But these are the most well-documented and commonly used manifestations available to all psionic creatures.</text>

<text>Amplify</text>
<text>Casting Time: 1 action</text>
<text>Duration: 1 round</text>
<text>Range: Self</text>
<text>Charges: 4</text>
<text>The dragon focuses the power of its mind and wreaths its teeth, claws, and tail in glowing psionic force. For the next minute, all of its melee attacks deal an extra 3d8 psychic damage.</text>

<text>What if things had been different? Maybe in another world, I am the wizard, and you are the fighter!</text>
<text>  Target two enemies. Both must succeed on an Intelligence saving throw or else swap character sheets until they take a short rest.</text>

<text>Believe</text>
<text>Casting Time: 1 action</text>
<text>Duration: 1 round</text>
<text>Range: 60 ft</text>
<text>Charges: 10</text>
<text>Target one creature. The dragon infects the mind of the target with a new belief. The target must succeed on an Intelligence saving throw or suffer an effect chosen from the list below.</text>
<text>  Friends: Until the end of its next turn, the target will not attack enemy combatants, and enemies have advantage on their next attack against this target.</text>
<text>  Enemies: On its next action, the target will move to the closest ally and attack it.</text>
<text>  Chasm: The target perceives a chasm opening up beneath it. It falls prone and takes 1d8 psychic damage. This belief persists—at the start of each round, the target makes an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, it continues feeling as though it is falling into an infinite abyss, taking 1d8 psychic damage.</text>
<text>  Wonder: The target spends a round doing nothing.</text>
<text>  Disaster: The target feels the world is ending and flees for one round.</text>
<text></text>

<text>Casting Time: 1 action</text>
<text>Duration: Instantaneous</text>
<text>Range: 30 ft</text>
<text>Charges: 1 per target</text>
<text>Space contorts and twists. Choose any number of targets the dragon can see within 30 feet. Each target must succeed on an Intelligence saving throw or be pushed back 30 feet.</text>

<text>Elsewhere</text>
<text>Casting Time: 1 action</text>
<text>Duration: Instantaneous</text>
<text>Range: 30 ft</text>
<text>Charges: 2 per feet</text>
<text>Pick a target within 30 feet. The target must succeed on an Intelligence saving throw or be teleported 5 feet per 2 charges spent. The destination must be within sight of the dragon and not currently occupied.</text>
<text></text>
<text>Flay</text>
<text>Casting Time: 1 bonus action</text>
<text>Duration: 1 round</text>
<text>Range: Self (60-foot cone)</text>
<text>Charges: 2 per d6 of damage</text>
<text>As a bonus action, the dragon blasts pure psionic energy from its eyes, frying the brains of all creatures in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, it takes psychic damage of a d6 per 2 charges spent, or half as much damage on a successful one.</text>
<text></text>
<text>Foget</text>
<text>Casting Time: 1 action</text>
<text>Duration: Special</text>
<text>Range: 60 ft</text>
<text>Charges: 5 + 1 per spell level if a spell is chosen</text>
<text>The dragon reaches into an enemy’s mind and plucks a critical memory from their cortex, either the knowledge of a spell or of a weapon. This effect lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The dragon can only use this manifestation once every ten minutes on the same target. Saving against the manifestation means the target is immune to Forget for 24 hours.</text>
<text>  Spells: Pick a target and choose a spell the target knows. Spend charges equal in number to 5 plus the spell level. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target cannot cast that spell until the effect of this manifestation ends.</text>
<text>  Weapons: Pick a target and choose a weapon. Spend 3 extra charges. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target does not gain the benefit of their proficiency bonus with the chosen kind of weapon while the effect lasts. (For example, they might forget how to use a longsword, but still gain their proficiency benefit with shortswords.)</text>
<text></text>
<text>Mindscape</text>
<text>Casting Time: 1 action</text>
<text>Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute</text>
<text>Range: 30 ft</text>
<text>Charges: 3 + 1 charge per round</text>
<text>The dragon implants a vision of a new landscape in the target’s mind, making them blind to their actual surroundings, causing them to move randomly and erratically. Choose a target to make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, this manifestation becomes active. If the target chooses to move while the manifestation is active, it moves 10 feet in a random direction (roll 1d8) instead of the distance and direc- tion it intended.</text>
<text></text>
<text>The Real</text>
<text>Casting Time: 1 action</text>
<text>Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour</text>
<text>Range: Self</text>
<text>Charges: 4</text>
<text>The dragon sees the real reality. It can tell what is an illusion, and it sees invisible creatures and creatures hidden or disguised by magic. Magical darkness does not affect it, and it can see into the Ethereal Plane.</text>
<text></text>
<text>Reflection</text>
<text>Casting Time: 1 action</text>
<text>Duration: 1 minute</text>
<text>Range: Self</text>
<text>Charges: 10 + reflection rank</text>
<text>The dragon reaches through time and plucks an ally from the timescape to come and fight alongside it. Choose a row from the Servitors chart. The cost of manifesting a reflection is 10 charges plus the type of the summoned creature on the table. (For example, summoning the Inexorable of Nature costs 16 charges: 10 plus the Inexorable’s type of 6.)</text>
<text></text>
<text>Sympathy</text>
<text>Casting Time: 1 reaction</text>
<text>Duration: Instantaneous</text>
<text>Range: 30 ft</text>
<text>Charges: 2 charges per d8</text>
<text>The dragon violently reacts to being hurt, raking its enemy’s nervous system with sympathetic psionic vibrations.</text>
<text>  As a reaction to taking damage from something the dragon can see within 30 feet, the dragon expends charges to force the damaging creature to make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 1d8 psychic damage per 2 charges spent. The maximum damage this can deal equals the damage dealt to the dragon that prompted this manifestation.</text>
<text></text>
<text>Weight</text>
<text>Casting Time: 1 reaction</text>
<text>Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute</text>
<text>Range: 30 ft</text>
<text>Charges: 3 + 1 charge per round</text>
<text>The gemstone dragons know that the weave of the timescape isn’t a true force—it’s little more than a quirk of geometry. One they can enhance or reverse at their discretion.</text>
<text>  Choose a target within range and select either Levitas or Gravitas. The target must succeed on an Intelligence saving throw or suffer the effect described below.</text>
<text>  Levitas: The target rises 10 feet per round. A levitating target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, until they save. When the target eventually hits the ground, it takes 1d6 damage per 10 feet fallen, with the maximum dice equal to their level (e.g., 5d6 for level 5).</text>
<text>  Gravitas: The target’s movement is reduced to 10 feet.</text>

    <trait>
        <name>Matrix Mind</name>
        <text>The gemstone dragons can maintain several persistent manifestations simultaneously but doing so requires expending 1 charge per manifestation at the start of each round. Damage disrupts psionic concentration just as it does a spell, but the saving throw is based on Intelligence rather than Constitution.</text>

<text>The crystals that grow on and thread through their bodies form a network of psionic filaments that capture, conduct, amplify, and store charges of psionic energies, which the dragons then convert into manifestations.</text>
<text>Each dragon begins with a number of charges based on their age. They can expend these charges to cast any psionic manifestation. Many of these manifestations have a base cost and can be enhanced by expending more charges.</text>
<text>Over time, the dragon’s crystals conduct more psionic energies into its body, recharging its power. At the end of each round, roll the recharge die and restore that many charges.</text>
<text>Each dragon also has a fracture rating. Each time it takes more damage than its fracture rating from a single attack, its crystalline form fractures, diminishing its ability to recharge its power. Roll the recharge die and reduce the dragon’s total charges by the result. This damage heals itself upon finishing a long rest.</text>

<text>Psionic charges are used to manifest psionic abilities. These manifestations are the primary source of a gemstone dragon’s power. All manifestations have a range of 30 feet, unless noted otherwise.</text>
<text>The following manifestations are by no means the only ones the dragons have access to. It is known that the most powerful gemstone dragons can alter their form at will in a manner that defies all inspection. But these are the most well-documented and commonly used manifestations available to all psionic creatures.</text>

<text>Target one creature. The dragon infects the mind of the target with a new belief. The target must succeed on an Intelligence saving throw or suffer an effect chosen from the list below.</text>
<text>	Friends: Until the end of its next turn, the target will not attack enemy combatants, and enemies have advantage on their next attack against this target.</text>
<text>	Enemies: On its next action, the target will move to the closest ally and attack it.</text>
<text>	Chasm: The target perceives a chasm opening up beneath it. It falls prone and takes 1d8 psychic damage. This belief persists—at the start of each round, the target makes an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, it continues feeling as though it is falling into an infinite abyss, taking 1d8 psychic damage.</text>

<text>As a bonus action, the dragon blasts pure psionic energy from its eyes, frying the brains of all creatures in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make an Intelligence saving throw.

<text>The dragon reaches into an enemy’s mind and plucks a critical memory from their cortex, either the knowledge of a spell or of a weapon. This effect lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The dragon can only use this manifestation once every ten minutes on the same target. Saving against the manifestation means the target is immune to Forget for 24 hours.</text>
<text>	Spells: Pick a target and choose a spell the target knows. Spend charges equal in number to 5 plus the spell level. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target cannot cast that spell until the effect of this manifestation ends.</text>
<text>	Weapons: Pick a target and choose a weapon. Spend 3 extra charges. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target does not gain the benefit of their proficiency bonus with the chosen kind of weapon while the effect lasts. (For example, they might forget how to use a longsword, but still gain their proficiency benefit with shortswords.)</text>

<text>The dragon implants a vision of a new landscape in the target’s mind, making them blind to their actual surroundings, causing them to move randomly and erratically. Choose a target to make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, this manifestation becomes active. If the target chooses to move while the manifestation is active, it moves 10 feet in a random direction (roll 1d8) instead of the distance and direc- tion it intended.</text>

<text>The dragon reaches through time and plucks an ally from the timescape to come and fight alongside it. Choose a row from the Servitors chart. The cost of manifesting a reflection is 10 charges plus the type of the summoned creature on the table. (For example, summoning the Inexorable of Nature costs 16 charges: 10 plus the Inexorable’s type of 6.)</text>

<text>The dragon violently reacts to being hurt, raking its enemy’s nervous system with sympathetic psionic vibrations.</text>
<text>	As a reaction to taking damage from something the dragon can see within 30 feet, the dragon expends charges to force the damaging creature to make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 1d8 psychic damage per 2 charges spent. The maximum damage this can deal equals the damage dealt to the dragon that prompted this manifestation.</text>

<text>	Choose a target within range and select either Levitas or Gravitas. The target must succeed on an Intelligence saving throw or suffer the effect described below.</text>
<text>	Levitas: The target rises 10 feet per round. A levitating target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, until they save. When the target eventually hits the ground, it takes 1d6 damage per 10 feet fallen, with the maximum dice equal to their level (e.g., 5d6 for level 5).</text>

        <name>Psionics</name>
<text>The gemstone dragons are silico-organic organisms. When hatched, they are almost entirely organic. As they grow, their crystalline structure grows, as does their psionic power.</text>
<text>The crystals that grow on and thread through their bodies form a network of psionic filaments that capture, conduct, amplify, and store charges of psionic energies, which the dragons then convert into manifestations.</text>
<text>Each dragon begins with a number of charges based on their age. They can expend these charges to cast any psionic manifestation. Many of these manifestations have a base cost and can be enhanced by expending more charges.</text>
<text>Over time, the dragon’s crystals conduct more psionic energies into its body, recharging its power. At the end of each round, roll the recharge die and restore that many charges.</text>
<text>Each dragon also has a fracture rating. Each time it takes more damage than its fracture rating from a single attack, its crystalline form fractures, diminishing its ability to recharge its power. Roll the recharge die and reduce the dragon’s total charges by the result. This damage heals itself upon finishing a long rest.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait>
        <name>Manifestations</name>
<text>Psionic charges are used to manifest psionic abilities. These manifestations are the primary source of a gemstone dragon’s power. All manifestations have a range of 30 feet, unless noted otherwise.</text>
<text>The following manifestations are by no means the only ones the dragons have access to. It is known that the most powerful gemstone dragons can alter their form at will in a manner that defies all inspection. But these are the most well-documented and commonly used manifestations available to all psionic creatures.</text>

<text>Amplify</text>
<text>Casting Time: 1 action</text>
<text>Duration: 1 round</text>
<text>Range: Self</text>
<text>Charges: 4</text>
<text>The dragon focuses the power of its mind and wreaths its teeth, claws, and tail in glowing psionic force. For the next minute, all of its melee attacks deal an extra 3d8 psychic damage.</text>

<text>Believe</text>
<text>Casting Time: 1 action</text>
<text>Duration: 1 round</text>
<text>Range: 60 ft</text>
<text>Charges: 10</text>
<text>Target one creature. The dragon infects the mind of the target with a new belief. The target must succeed on an Intelligence saving throw or suffer an effect chosen from the list below.</text>
<text>  Friends: Until the end of its next turn, the target will not attack enemy combatants, and enemies have advantage on their next attack against this target.</text>
<text>  Enemies: On its next action, the target will move to the closest ally and attack it.</text>
<text>  Chasm: The target perceives a chasm opening up beneath it. It falls prone and takes 1d8 psychic damage. This belief persists—at the start of each round, the target makes an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, it continues feeling as though it is falling into an infinite abyss, taking 1d8 psychic damage.</text>
<text>  Wonder: The target spends a round doing nothing.</text>
<text>  Disaster: The target feels the world is ending and flees for one round.</text>

<text>Space contorts and twists. Choose any number of targets the dragon can see within 30 feet. Each target must succeed on an Intelligence saving throw or be pushed back 30 feet.</text>

<text>Elsewhere</text>
<text>Casting Time: 1 action</text>
<text>Duration: Instantaneous</text>
<text>Range: 30 ft</text>
<text>Charges: 2 per feet</text>
<text>Pick a target within 30 feet. The target must succeed on an Intelligence saving throw or be teleported 5 feet per 2 charges spent. The destination must be within sight of the dragon and not currently occupied.</text>

<text>Casting Time: 1 bonus action</text>
<text>Duration: 1 round</text>
<text>Range: Self (60-foot cone)</text>
<text>Charges: 2 per d6 of damage</text>
<text>As a bonus action, the dragon blasts pure psionic energy from its eyes, frying the brains of all creatures in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, it takes psychic damage of a d6 per 2 charges spent, or half as much damage on a successful one.</text>

<text>Foget</text>
<text>Casting Time: 1 action</text>
<text>Duration: Special</text>
<text>Range: 60 ft</text>
<text>Charges: 5 + 1 per spell level if a spell is chosen</text>
<text>The dragon reaches into an enemy’s mind and plucks a critical memory from their cortex, either the knowledge of a spell or of a weapon. This effect lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The dragon can only use this manifestation once every ten minutes on the same target. Saving against the manifestation means the target is immune to Forget for 24 hours.</text>
<text>  Spells: Pick a target and choose a spell the target knows. Spend charges equal in number to 5 plus the spell level. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target cannot cast that spell until the effect of this manifestation ends.</text>
<text>  Weapons: Pick a target and choose a weapon. Spend 3 extra charges. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target does not gain the benefit of their proficiency bonus with the chosen kind of weapon while the effect lasts. (For example, they might forget how to use a longsword, but still gain their proficiency benefit with shortswords.)</text>

<text>Mindscape</text>
<text>Casting Time: 1 action</text>
<text>Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute</text>
<text>Range: 30 ft</text>
<text>Charges: 3 + 1 charge per round</text>
<text>The dragon implants a vision of a new landscape in the target’s mind, making them blind to their actual surroundings, causing them to move randomly and erratically. Choose a target to make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, this manifestation becomes active. If the target chooses to move while the manifestation is active, it moves 10 feet in a random direction (roll 1d8) instead of the distance and direc- tion it intended.</text>
<text></text>
<text>The Real</text>
<text>Casting Time: 1 action</text>
<text>Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour</text>
<text>Range: Self</text>
<text>Charges: 4</text>
<text>The dragon sees the real reality. It can tell what is an illusion, and it sees invisible creatures and creatures hidden or disguised by magic. Magical darkness does not affect it, and it can see into the Ethereal Plane.</text>
<text></text>
<text>Reflection</text>
<text>Casting Time: 1 action</text>
<text>Duration: 1 minute</text>
<text>Range: Self</text>
<text>Charges: 10 + reflection rank</text>
<text>The dragon reaches through time and plucks an ally from the timescape to come and fight alongside it. Choose a row from the Servitors chart. The cost of manifesting a reflection is 10 charges plus the type of the summoned creature on the table. (For example, summoning the Inexorable of Nature costs 16 charges: 10 plus the Inexorable’s type of 6.)</text>
<text></text>
<text>Sympathy</text>
<text>Casting Time: 1 reaction</text>
<text>Duration: Instantaneous</text>
<text>Range: 30 ft</text>
<text>Charges: 2 charges per d8</text>
<text>The dragon violently reacts to being hurt, raking its enemy’s nervous system with sympathetic psionic vibrations.</text>
<text>  As a reaction to taking damage from something the dragon can see within 30 feet, the dragon expends charges to force the damaging creature to make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 1d8 psychic damage per 2 charges spent. The maximum damage this can deal equals the damage dealt to the dragon that prompted this manifestation.</text>
<text></text>
<text>Weight</text>
<text>Casting Time: 1 reaction</text>
<text>Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute</text>
<text>Range: 30 ft</text>
<text>Charges: 3 + 1 charge per round</text>
<text>The gemstone dragons know that the weave of the timescape isn’t a true force—it’s little more than a quirk of geometry. One they can enhance or reverse at their discretion.</text>
<text>  Choose a target within range and select either Levitas or Gravitas. The target must succeed on an Intelligence saving throw or suffer the effect described below.</text>
<text>  Levitas: The target rises 10 feet per round. A levitating target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, until they save. When the target eventually hits the ground, it takes 1d6 damage per 10 feet fallen, with the maximum dice equal to their level (e.g., 5d6 for level 5).</text>
<text>  Gravitas: The target’s movement is reduced to 10 feet.</text>

    <trait>
        <name>Matrix Mind</name>
        <text>The gemstone dragons can maintain several persistent manifestations simultaneously but doing so requires expending 1 charge per manifestation at the start of each round. Damage disrupts psionic concentration just as it does a spell, but the saving throw is based on Intelligence rather than Constitution.</text>

<text>	Friends: Until the end of its next turn, the target will not attack enemy combatants, and enemies have advantage on their next attack against this target.</text>
<text>	Enemies: On its next action, the target will move to the closest ally and attack it.</text>
<text>	Chasm: The target perceives a chasm opening up beneath it. It falls prone and takes 1d8 psychic damage. This belief persists—at the start of each round, the target makes an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, it continues feeling as though it is falling into an infinite abyss, taking 1d8 psychic damage.</text>

<text>The dragon reaches into an enemy’s mind and plucks a critical memory from their cortex, either the knowledge of a spell or of a weapon. This effect lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The dragon can only use this manifestation once every ten minutes on the same target. Saving against the manifestation means the target is immune to Forget for 24 hours.</text>

<text>	Weapons: Pick a target and choose a weapon. Spend 3 extra charges. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target does not gain the benefit of their proficiency bonus with the chosen kind of weapon while the effect lasts. (For example, they might forget how to use a longsword, but still gain their proficiency benefit with shortswords.)</text>

<text>The dragon reaches through time and plucks an ally from the timescape to come and fight alongside it. Choose a row from the Servitors chart.

<text>	As a reaction to taking damage from something the dragon can see within 30 feet, the dragon expends charges to force the damaging creature to make an Intelligence saving throw.

<text>	Choose a target within range and select either Levitas or Gravitas. The target must succeed on an Intelligence saving throw or suffer the effect described below.</text>
<text>	Levitas: The target rises 10 feet per round. A levitating target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, until they save. When the target eventually hits the ground, it takes 1d6 damage per 10 feet fallen, with the maximum dice equal to their level (e.g., 5d6 for level 5).</text>

    <trait>
        <name>Psionics</name>
<text>The gemstone dragons are silico-organic organisms. When hatched, they are almost entirely organic. As they grow, their crystalline structure grows, as does their psionic power.</text>
<text>The crystals that grow on and thread through their bodies form a network of psionic filaments that capture, conduct, amplify, and store charges of psionic energies, which the dragons then convert into manifestations.</text>
<text>Each dragon begins with a number of charges based on their age. They can expend these charges to cast any psionic manifestation. Many of these manifestations have a base cost and can be enhanced by expending more charges.</text>
<text>Over time, the dragon’s crystals conduct more psionic energies into its body, recharging its power. At the end of each round, roll the recharge die and restore that many charges.</text>
<text>Each dragon also has a fracture rating. Each time it takes more damage than its fracture rating from a single attack, its crystalline form fractures, diminishing its ability to recharge its power. Roll the recharge die and reduce the dragon’s total charges by the result. This damage heals itself upon finishing a long rest.</text>

    <trait>
        <name>Manifestations</name>
<text>Psionic charges are used to manifest psionic abilities. These manifestations are the primary source of a gemstone dragon’s power. All manifestations have a range of 30 feet, unless noted otherwise.</text>
<text>The following manifestations are by no means the only ones the dragons have access to. It is known that the most powerful gemstone dragons can alter their form at will in a manner that defies all inspection. But these are the most well-documented and commonly used manifestations available to all psionic creatures.</text>

<text>Psionic charges are used to manifest psionic abilities. These manifestations are the primary source of a gemstone dragon’s power. All manifestations have a range of 30 feet, unless noted otherwise.</text>
<text>The following manifestations are by no means the only ones the dragons have access to. It is known that the most powerful gemstone dragons can alter their form at will in a manner that defies all inspection. But these are the most well-documented and commonly used manifestations available to all psionic creatures.</text>

<text>The dragon focuses the power of its mind and wreaths its teeth, claws, and tail in glowing psionic force. For the next minute, all of its melee attacks deal an extra 3d8 psychic damage.</text>

<text>Casting Time: 1 action</text>
<text>Duration: 1 round</text>
<text>Range: 60 ft</text>
<text>Charges: 10</text>
<text>Target one creature. The dragon infects the mind of the target with a new belief. The target must succeed on an Intelligence saving throw or suffer an effect chosen from the list below.</text>
<text>  Friends: Until the end of its next turn, the target will not attack enemy combatants, and enemies have advantage on their next attack against this target.</text>
<text>  Enemies: On its next action, the target will move to the closest ally and attack it.</text>
<text>  Chasm: The target perceives a chasm opening up beneath it. It falls prone and takes 1d8 psychic damage. This belief persists—at the start of each round, the target makes an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, it continues feeling as though it is falling into an infinite abyss, taking 1d8 psychic damage.</text>
<text>  Wonder: The target spends a round doing nothing.</text>
<text>  Disaster: The target feels the world is ending and flees for one round.</text>

<text>Duration: Instantaneous</text>
<text>Range: 30 ft</text>
<text>Charges: 2 per feet</text>
<text>Pick a target within 30 feet. The target must succeed on an Intelligence saving throw or be teleported 5 feet per 2 charges spent. The destination must be within sight of the dragon and not currently occupied.</text>

<text>Casting Time: 1 bonus action</text>
<text>Duration: 1 round</text>
<text>Range: Self (60-foot cone)</text>
<text>Charges: 2 per d6 of damage</text>
<text>As a bonus action, the dragon blasts pure psionic energy from its eyes, frying the brains of all creatures in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, it takes psychic damage of a d6 per 2 charges spent, or half as much damage on a successful one.</text>

<text>Casting Time: 1 action</text>
<text>Duration: Special</text>
<text>Range: 60 ft</text>
<text>Charges: 5 + 1 per spell level if a spell is chosen</text>
<text>The dragon reaches into an enemy’s mind and plucks a critical memory from their cortex, either the knowledge of a spell or of a weapon. This effect lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The dragon can only use this manifestation once every ten minutes on the same target. Saving against the manifestation means the target is immune to Forget for 24 hours.</text>
<text>  Spells: Pick a target and choose a spell the target knows. Spend charges equal in number to 5 plus the spell level. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target cannot cast that spell until the effect of this manifestation ends.</text>
<text>  Weapons: Pick a target and choose a weapon. Spend 3 extra charges. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target does not gain the benefit of their proficiency bonus with the chosen kind of weapon while the effect lasts. (For example, they might forget how to use a longsword, but still gain their proficiency benefit with shortswords.)</text>

<text>Casting Time: 1 action</text>
<text>Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute</text>
<text>Range: 30 ft</text>
<text>Charges: 3 + 1 charge per round</text>
<text>The dragon implants a vision of a new landscape in the target’s mind, making them blind to their actual surroundings, causing them to move randomly and erratically. Choose a target to make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, this manifestation becomes active. If the target chooses to move while the manifestation is active, it moves 10 feet in a random direction (roll 1d8) instead of the distance and direc- tion it intended.</text>
<text></text>
<text>The Real</text>
<text>Casting Time: 1 action</text>
<text>Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour</text>
<text>Range: Self</text>
<text>Charges: 4</text>
<text>The dragon sees the real reality. It can tell what is an illusion, and it sees invisible creatures and creatures hidden or disguised by magic. Magical darkness does not affect it, and it can see into the Ethereal Plane.</text>
<text></text>
<text>Reflection</text>
<text>Casting Time: 1 action</text>
<text>Duration: 1 minute</text>
<text>Range: Self</text>
<text>Charges: 10 + reflection rank</text>
<text>The dragon reaches through time and plucks an ally from the timescape to come and fight alongside it. Choose a row from the Servitors chart. The cost of manifesting a reflection is 10 charges plus the type of the summoned creature on the table. (For example, summoning the Inexorable of Nature costs 16 charges: 10 plus the Inexorable’s type of 6.)</text>
<text></text>
<text>Sympathy</text>
<text>Casting Time: 1 reaction</text>
<text>Duration: Instantaneous</text>
<text>Range: 30 ft</text>
<text>Charges: 2 charges per d8</text>
<text>The dragon violently reacts to being hurt, raking its enemy’s nervous system with sympathetic psionic vibrations.</text>
<text>  As a reaction to taking damage from something the dragon can see within 30 feet, the dragon expends charges to force the damaging creature to make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 1d8 psychic damage per 2 charges spent. The maximum damage this can deal equals the damage dealt to the dragon that prompted this manifestation.</text>
<text></text>

<text>Casting Time: 1 reaction</text>
<text>Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute</text>
<text>Range: 30 ft</text>
<text>Charges: 3 + 1 charge per round</text>
<text>The gemstone dragons know that the weave of the timescape isn’t a true force—it’s little more than a quirk of geometry. One they can enhance or reverse at their discretion.</text>
<text>  Choose a target within range and select either Levitas or Gravitas. The target must succeed on an Intelligence saving throw or suffer the effect described below.</text>
<text>  Levitas: The target rises 10 feet per round. A levitating target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, until they save. When the target eventually hits the ground, it takes 1d6 damage per 10 feet fallen, with the maximum dice equal to their level (e.g., 5d6 for level 5).</text>
<text>  Gravitas: The target’s movement is reduced to 10 feet.</text>

    <trait>
        <name>Psionics</name>
<text>The gemstone dragons are silico-organic organisms. When hatched, they are almost entirely organic. As they grow, their crystalline structure grows, as does their psionic power.</text>
<text>The crystals that grow on and thread through their bodies form a network of psionic filaments that capture, conduct, amplify, and store charges of psionic energies, which the dragons then convert into manifestations.</text>
<text>Each dragon begins with a number of charges based on their age. They can expend these charges to cast any psionic manifestation. Many of these manifestations have a base cost and can be enhanced by expending more charges.</text>
<text>Over time, the dragon’s crystals conduct more psionic energies into its body, recharging its power. At the end of each round, roll the recharge die and restore that many charges.</text>
<text>Each dragon also has a fracture rating. Each time it takes more damage than its fracture rating from a single attack, its crystalline form fractures, diminishing its ability to recharge its power. Roll the recharge die and reduce the dragon’s total charges by the result. This damage heals itself upon finishing a long rest.</text>

        <name>Psionics</name>
<text>The gemstone dragons are silico-organic organisms. When hatched, they are almost entirely organic. As they grow, their crystalline structure grows, as does their psionic power.</text>
<text>The crystals that grow on and thread through their bodies form a network of psionic filaments that capture, conduct, amplify, and store charges of psionic energies, which the dragons then convert into manifestations.</text>
<text>Each dragon begins with a number of charges based on their age. They can expend these charges to cast any psionic manifestation. Many of these manifestations have a base cost and can be enhanced by expending more charges.</text>
<text>Over time, the dragon’s crystals conduct more psionic energies into its body, recharging its power. At the end of each round, roll the recharge die and restore that many charges.</text>
<text>Each dragon also has a fracture rating. Each time it takes more damage than its fracture rating from a single attack, its crystalline form fractures, diminishing its ability to recharge its power. Roll the recharge die and reduce the dragon’s total charges by the result. This damage heals itself upon finishing a long rest.</text>

It is known that the most powerful gemstone dragons can alter their form at will in a manner that defies all inspection.

<text>Target one creature. The dragon infects the mind of the target with a new belief. The target must succeed on an Intelligence saving throw or suffer an effect chosen from the list below.</text>
<text>  Friends: Until the end of its next turn, the target will not attack enemy combatants, and enemies have advantage on their next attack against this target.</text>
<text>  Enemies: On its next action, the target will move to the closest ally and attack it.</text>
<text>  Chasm: The target perceives a chasm opening up beneath it. It falls prone and takes 1d8 psychic damage. This belief persists—at the start of each round, the target makes an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, it continues feeling as though it is falling into an infinite abyss, taking 1d8 psychic damage.</text>
<text>  Wonder: The target spends a round doing nothing.</text>
<text>  Disaster: The target feels the world is ending and flees for one round.</text>

<text>As a bonus action, the dragon blasts pure psionic energy from its eyes, frying the brains of all creatures in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, it takes psychic damage of a d6 per 2 charges spent, or half as much damage on a successful one.</text>

<text>Charges: 5 + 1 per spell level if a spell is chosen</text>
<text>The dragon reaches into an enemy’s mind and plucks a critical memory from their cortex, either the knowledge of a spell or of a weapon. This effect lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The dragon can only use this manifestation once every ten minutes on the same target. Saving against the manifestation means the target is immune to Forget for 24 hours.</text>
<text>  Spells: Pick a target and choose a spell the target knows. Spend charges equal in number to 5 plus the spell level. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target cannot cast that spell until the effect of this manifestation ends.</text>
<text>  Weapons: Pick a target and choose a weapon. Spend 3 extra charges. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target does not gain the benefit of their proficiency bonus with the chosen kind of weapon while the effect lasts. (For example, they might forget how to use a longsword, but still gain their proficiency benefit with shortswords.)</text>

<text>Charges: 3 + 1 charge per round</text>
<text>The dragon implants a vision of a new landscape in the target’s mind, making them blind to their actual surroundings, causing them to move randomly and erratically. Choose a target to make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, this manifestation becomes active. If the target chooses to move while the manifestation is active, it moves 10 feet in a random direction (roll 1d8) instead of the distance and direc- tion it intended.</text>

<text>The Real</text>
<text>Casting Time: 1 action</text>
<text>Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour</text>
<text>Range: Self</text>
<text>Charges: 4</text>
<text>The dragon sees the real reality. It can tell what is an illusion, and it sees invisible creatures and creatures hidden or disguised by magic. Magical darkness does not affect it, and it can see into the Ethereal Plane.</text>

<text>Reflection</text>
<text>Casting Time: 1 action</text>
<text>Duration: 1 minute</text>
<text>Range: Self</text>
<text>Charges: 10 + reflection rank</text>
<text>The dragon reaches through time and plucks an ally from the timescape to come and fight alongside it. Choose a row from the Servitors chart. The cost of manifesting a reflection is 10 charges plus the type of the summoned creature on the table. (For example, summoning the Inexorable of Nature costs 16 charges: 10 plus the Inexorable’s type of 6.)</text>

<text>Casting Time: 1 reaction</text>
<text>Duration: Instantaneous</text>
<text>Range: 30 ft</text>
<text>Charges: 2 charges per d8</text>
<text>The dragon violently reacts to being hurt, raking its enemy’s nervous system with sympathetic psionic vibrations.</text>
<text>  As a reaction to taking damage from something the dragon can see within 30 feet, the dragon expends charges to force the damaging creature to make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 1d8 psychic damage per 2 charges spent. The maximum damage this can deal equals the damage dealt to the dragon that prompted this manifestation.</text>

<text>The gemstone dragons know that the weave of the timescape isn’t a true force—it’s little more than a quirk of geometry. One they can enhance or reverse at their discretion.</text>
<text>  Choose a target within range and select either Levitas or Gravitas. The target must succeed on an Intelligence saving throw or suffer the effect described below.</text>
<text>  Levitas: The target rises 10 feet per round. A levitating target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, until they save. When the target eventually hits the ground, it takes 1d6 damage per 10 feet fallen, with the maximum dice equal to their level (e.g., 5d6 for level 5).</text>
<text>  Gravitas: The target’s movement is reduced to 10 feet.</text>

    </trait>
    <trait>
        <name>Psionics</name>
<text>The gemstone dragons are silico-organic organisms. When hatched, they are almost entirely organic. As they grow, their crystalline structure grows, as does their psionic power.</text>
<text>The crystals that grow on and thread through their bodies form a network of psionic filaments that capture, conduct, amplify, and store charges of psionic energies, which the dragons then convert into manifestations.</text>
<text>Each dragon begins with a number of charges based on their age. They can expend these charges to cast any psionic manifestation. Many of these manifestations have a base cost and can be enhanced by expending more charges.</text>
<text>Over time, the dragon’s crystals conduct more psionic energies into its body, recharging its power. At the end of each round, roll the recharge die and restore that many charges.</text>
<text>Each dragon also has a fracture rating. Each time it takes more damage than its fracture rating from a single attack, its crystalline form fractures, diminishing its ability to recharge its power. Roll the recharge die and reduce the dragon’s total charges by the result. This damage heals itself upon finishing a long rest.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait>
        <name>Manifestations</name>
<text>Psionic charges are used to manifest psionic abilities. These manifestations are the primary source of a gemstone dragon’s power. All manifestations have a range of 30 feet, unless noted otherwise.</text>
<text>The following manifestations are by no means the only ones the dragons have access to. It is known that the most powerful gemstone dragons can alter their form at will in a manner that defies all inspection. But these are the most well-documented and commonly used manifestations available to all psionic creatures.</text>
