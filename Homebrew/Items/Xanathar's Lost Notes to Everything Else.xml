		<text>This mithral longsword is of elven design, bearing runes along the blade that read "Arelind", an ancient elven word that means "Champion of the People". These blades were often gifts given by elven wizards to non-elven allies of great esteem.</text>
		<text>	You have a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this weapon. It sheds dim light in a 5-foot radius when unsheathed. You can speak, read, and write the elven language so long as the sword is on your person.</text>

		<name>Belt of Hidden Knives</name>
		<type>W</type>
		<weight/>
		<value/>
		<text>Rarity: very rare</text>
		<text>This appears to be a simple, unassuming black leather belt when wrapped around the user's waist. When removed, a small diamond can be seen stitched into the belt's underside. Each time this belt is buckled, it sounds like a sword being drawn from a sheath. As part of an attack, you can draw a hidden +2 dagger from the belt. If the dagger leaves your hands it ceases to exist at the end of your turn. The belt doesn't run out of daggers. You must be wearing the belt to use this property.</text>

		<name>Belt of the Monkey</name>
		<type>W</type>
		<value/>
		<text>Rarity: Uncommon</text>
		<text>Requires Attunement</text>
		<text>This metal belt is made of silver monkeys locked arm in arm with tiny pieces of jade for each primate's eyes. While wearing it, you feel the tickling urge to treat the world as a playground by swinging on objects, climbing trees, and scaling buildings. While wearing this belt you add double your proficiency to Strength (Athletics) checks to climb.</text>
		<text>	As an action any tail you have becomes prehensile for an hour. If you don't have a tail, you grow a 3-foot prehensile tail out of your posterior for an hour. You can hang from your tail, provided it has something to hold onto. Your tail also acts as a third arm and hand, allowing you to manipulate and wield objects that weigh 5 lbs. or less. In this state you could hold three weapons at once, but you can still only fight with two at a time. You can't use this ability again until you have completed a long rest.</text>

		<name>Bow of Grounding</name>
		<type>R</type>
		<value/>
		<text>Rarity: rare</text>
		<text>Requires Attunement</text>
		<text>A stiff but bendable chain makes up the curvature of this longbow. Each link of chain has a small pink pearl in the center. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage roll made with this longbow. When you shoot a creature with a flying speed with this bow, it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or have its flying speed reduced by 10 feet. The target must complete a short rest before it can regain any speed lost in this way.</text>

		<name>Box of Shrinking</name>
		<type>W</type>
		<value/>
		<text>These plain boxes are carved with Dwarvish runes, surprisingly light, and roughly the size of a loaf of bread. Inside, the box is much more extravagant, lined with crushed velvet and studded with gems. An old dwarf nursery rhyme plays when the box is open. "The Legend of Calibra Daliq" is about a dwarf wizard thief who shrunk herself to sneak past guards and locked doors in order to get her riches.</text>
		<text>The DM either rolls to determine the box's type or chooses one from the options available.</text>
		<text/>
		<text>Box of Shrinking Type</text>
		<text>d100    Metal         Original object space    Rarity</text>
		<text>01-50   Iron          5-ft cube or smaller     Uncommon</text>
		<text>51-80   Steel         10-ft cube or smaller    Rare</text>
		<text>81-95   Mithral       15-ft cube or smaller    Very Rare</text>
		<text>96-100  Adamantine    20-ft cube or smaller    Legendary</text>
		<text>	You can use the box of shrinking's Grow and Shrink abilities once per day each. You must be holding the box to use either ability.</text>
		<text>	Grow. As an action, any item previously shrunken by a box of shrinking of equal or lesser rarity and power may be grown. The item must be placed in the box of shrinking and its original size must be within the parameters on the table above. Once the command word is spoken the object appears in an unoccupied space adjacent to the box of shrinking. You must be holding the box of shrinking to use this ability.</text>
		<text>	Shrink. As an action you may speak a command word and one non-living object within 50 feet of the box of shrinking has its size reduced to a 1-inch cube, weighs half a pound, and is teleported into the box. The item stays this size until it is grown by a box of shrinking. The shrunken item may be no larger than specified on the table above.</text>

		<text>While holding this scimitar, you can use a bonus action to activate its brambles. When you do, several barbed vines coil around its crossguard, over your wrist, and dig into your flesh. At the start of each of your turns, it drains 2 hit points from you to empower its poison. While attached to you in this way, you can't be disarmed by normal means, and you are resistant to poison damage and immune to the poisoned condition. Each time the weapon drains your hit points, it gains one charge, to a maximum of 5 charges. The weapon continues to drain your hit points while fully charged.</text>
		<text>	On a hit, its vicious barbs lash out from the scimitar and rake your target with venomous brambles, expending all charges within its vines. The creature must make a Constitution saving throw with a DC equal to 10 + your proficiency bonus. On a failure, the creature takes 1d4 poison damage for each charge spent.</text>
		<text>	If you stow the weapon without expending all of its charges, the poison courses through your veins as you release the hilt and you must make a successful Constitution saving throw or take the damage from its thorns for each remaining charge.</text>

		<text>Light: A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons.</text>
		<text/>
		<text>Range: A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.</text>
		<text/>
		<text>Thrown: If a weapon has the thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the finesse property.</text>

The creature killed in this manner can't be resurrected. As a bonus action, the wielder can transfer the soul trapped into the bow into an arrow is it is fired. Such an arrow attacks with advantage and does an extra 3d6 necrotic damage on a hit. Once a soul leaves the bow, another can't enter the bow for a full 24 hours.</text>

		<text>This staff has a head carved of onyx and a shaft of gold and functions as a quarterstaff that grants +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. The staff has properties associated with six different buttons that are set in a row along its length.</text>
		<text>Six Buttons. You can press one of the staff's six buttons as a bonus action. A button's effect lasts until you push a different button or until you push the same button again, which causes the rod to revert to its normal form.</text>
		<text>If you press button 1, the staff becomes a frost brand greatsword as the top half of the staff transforms into an enormous blade.</text>
		<text>If you press button 2, the staff's onyx head transforms into an enormous hammer, turning the staff into a magic maul that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls.</text>
		<text>If you press button 3, the staff's onyx head lengthens and transforms into an pointed tip, transforming the staff into a magic pike that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls.</text>
		<text>If you press button 4, the staff floats on top of liquid like a piece of driftwood. The staff can float with up to 4,000 pounds of weight attached to it.</text>
		<text>If you press button 5, the onyx head of the staff sheds bright light in a 60-foot-radius sphere and dim light for an additional 60 feet.</text>
		<text>If you press button 6, the staff will suck up 50 gallons of any liquid its head is placed in. Pressing this button again causes the staff to release all the liquid at once out of its head.</text>
		<text>Detect Magic. While holding the staff you can use your action to cast the detect magic spell from it. This property can't be used again until next dawn.</text>
		<text>Detect Secret Doors and Traps. While holding the staff you can use your action to search for secret doors and traps. If a secret door or trap is within 30 feet of you, the staff's onyx head pulses with light and points at the one nearest to you. This property can't be used again until next dawn.</text>
		<text>Thunder Strike. When you hit a creature with a melee attack using the staff, you can force the target to make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. On a failure the target takes an extra 4d6 thunder damage and is knocked 20 feet away from you and lands prone. This property can't be used again until next dawn.</text>
		<text/>
		<text>Versatile: This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property â€” the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.</text>

		<name>Tromberd's Ladle</name>
		<type>W</type>
		<weight/>
		<dmg1/>
		<dmgType/>
		<property/>
		<value/>
		<text>Rarity: Rare</text>
		<text>This silver ladle was created by a dwarven cook named Tromberd, who acted as a cook for a successful adventuring party. As an acolyte of Moradin, Tromberd combined his divine, metalworking, and culinary skills to take his profession to new heights. He created a magical ladle that imbued the meals it made with magical healing properties. While the name and exploits of the adventuring company was lost to the ages, Tromberd's magical ladle has survived and continues to serve astounding and magical meals.</text>
		<text>When the ladle is used to cook a pot of soup or stew for at least 2 hours of constant stirring, the meal becomes magical food that can feed up to 8 creatures. The meal must contain at least 20 gp worth of ingredients, including rare herbs and spices. If the meal is eaten as part of a long rest, the number of hit dice recovered by the creatures eating the meal at the end of the long rest increases by 2 (to the creature's normal maximum). The creatures also gain 10 temporary hit points at the end of that long rest. Once used, the ladle's magic can't be used again until a week passes. The creature who cooks the meal can't gain the magical benefits of the food.</text>
