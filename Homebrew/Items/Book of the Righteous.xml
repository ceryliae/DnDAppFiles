		<text>Made from the feather of an angel, the celestial quill shines with the perfect light of Heaven, emitting bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light 30 feet beyond that distance. An evil creature that willingly touches a celestial quill takes 10d8 radiant damage, and the limb that touched it becomes permanently withered and useless, the effects of which are determined by the GM. The withering can be reversed by a wish spell.</text>
		<text>	Any other creature can touch and use the quill. If used as a writing implement, it cannot be used to write any untruth. Furthermore, when used to create spell scrolls to contain cleric or paladin spells, the quill halves the creation cost (see DMG for details on creating magic items).</text>

		<text>Eliwyn still grows in her sacred grove. Once every century, she sheds her leaves. Most of them are gathered by the druids tending her. Some, though, are carried away on the wind and reach mortal hands beyond. These leaves are imbued with life-giving and healing powers. The leaves are large and oval, about twelve inches long and six inches at the widest point. The tops of the leaves are deep green while their undersides are bright silver.</text>
		<text>	A leaf has several possible uses. First, as an action, you can crush the leaf, which causes it to emit a sweet odor and ooze milky sap that functions as six potions of healing to anyone who consumes it. Second, as an action, you can apply the leaf to the body of one creature you can reach, which causes the creature to be instantly cured of any disease, poison, curse, madness, or any other harmful ongoing effect. Finally, you can use the leaf in place of the material components required by the raise dead, reincarnate, resurrection, or true resurrection spells. When you do so, the target su ers no ill effects from coming back from the dead. Using the leaf in any of these ways consumes its power.</text>

		<text>While carrying one of the staves, you have advantage on saving throws against spells and resistance to spell damage.</text>
		<text/>
		<text>Spell Storage</text>
		<text>Each of the staves can store spells cast into it, holding them until the attuned wielder uses them. A staff can hold up to 15 levels' worth of spells at a time. Any creature can cast a spell of 1st through 5th level into the staff by touching it as the spell is cast. The spell has no effect, other than to be stored in the staff. If the staff cannot hold the spell, the spell is expended without effect. The level of the spell slot used to cast the spell determines how much space it uses. While holding the staff, you can cast any spell stored in it. The spell uses the slot level, spell save DC, spell attack bonus, and spellcasting ability of the original caster, but otherwise is treated as of you cast the spell. Once cast, the stored spell leaves the staff, freeing up space to store another spell.</text>
		<text/>
		<text>Spells</text>
		<text>While holding the staff, you can cast each of the following spells once per day using your spell save DC and spell attack bonus: dispel magic, geas, and teleport.</text>
		<text/>
		<text>You become so attuned to the scents of the world around you that you can detect subtle changes in your environment no one else would notice. While you hold the staff, you are constantly under the effects of the following spells: detect poison and disease, find traps, and see invisibility. You are also aware of the location of each creature and plant within 30 feet of you such that creatures within this range cannot hide from you. You count as if you do not need to breathe for the purpose of resisting certain attacks and spells such as stinking cloud. Finally, you add stinking cloud and cloudkill to the list of spells you can cast once per day from the staff.</text>

		<text/>
		<text>This is the golden ark in which the archangel Uriel bore magic to the mortal races. It has been lost since the time of antiquity, but scholars believe it is still hidden somewhere in the mortal sphere. Legend has it that in the time of greatest need, when the mortal races stand on the precipice of destruction, four great heroes will arise, bearing the ark.</text>
		<text>	The ark has four handles to bear it by. In classical depictions, Uriel stands before four unnamed angels who hold the ark by these handles. When these four handles are held, the ark provides the bearers with the raw power of magic. Each bearer must have one hand on the arc (usually holding the arc on the shoulder) for these powers to be available. This means that the bearer cannot move away from the arc by more than 5 feet.</text>
		<text>	The ark has 1,000 charges for some of the following properties. It replenishes all expended charges once each day at dawn.</text>
		<text>• Divine Aura. When borne, divine light washes out from it and coalesces in a soft radiance that spreads out in a 30-foot-radius sphere. Creatures bearing the ark have advantage on all saving throws and other creatures have disadvantage on attack rolls against them. In addition, when a fiend or an undead creature hits a bearer with a melee attack, the aura flashes with brilliant light. The attacker must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or become blinded for 24 hours.</text>
		<text>• Spells. When carried by four creatures, they can agree to use any of the following powers at the cost of 50 charges each. Any one of the four can use an action to cast power word kill or time stop.</text>
		<text>	• The bearer on the front left, the handle of fire, can cast any of the following spells at a cost of 10 charges: delayed blast fireball, meteor swarm, or sunburst.</text>
		<text>	• The bearer on the front right, the handle of water, can cast any of the following spells at a cost of 10 charges: cloud kill, mass heal, or storm of vengeance.</text>
		<text>	• The bearer on the back right, the handle of earth, can cast any of the following spells at a cost of 10 charges: antimagic field, earthquake, or regenerate</text>
		<text>	• The bearer on the back left, the handle of air, can cast any of the following spells at a cost of 10 charges: chain lightning, control wind, or thunderwave (as 9th-level spell).</text>
		<text>	With this ark, armies might be leveled and even the greatest foes toppled. However, tinkering with such powers can be dangerous to both the wielder and the world. Since the ark is the container that bore the raw magic to the material plane, if all the charges for a single day are used, magic in the mortal world ceases to function until the charges have been restored. Further, there is a 50% chance that everyone touching the ark when the last of its daily power is drained will be utterly destroyed. Some scholars hold that, should the ark be brought forth and its bearers defeated, it will mean the end of magic in the world.</text>

		<text>Rontra gave this mighty weapon to her mortal worshipers long ago, before the forming of the Compact. It is currently lost somewhere deep in the earth, its whereabouts known only to the Earth Mother herself. Legend tells that in time of need, when the land and its people are in grave danger, Grandmother Rontra will send one of her chosen mortal worshipers on a quest to prove their worth. If successful, she will bestow upon them this dire  ail, with its haft of purest silver and solid gold chains. The spiked balls are as clear as crystal, each bearing a sparkling light within. Although it appears delicate, the weapon is indestructible and powerful. But until the hero of prophecy wields it, scholars say it appears to be a common flail, as much like a farm implement as a weapon of war.</text>
		<text>	• Magic Weapon. the Flail of Rontra is a magic weapon that grants a +3 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls. In addition, when you hit a fiend or undead with the weapon, that creature takes an extra 3d10 radiant damage.</text>
		<text>	• Rontra's Ward. While you carry the flail, you are immune to necrotic damage, you emit dim light in a 5-foot-radius, and any fiend or undead that hits you with an attack must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be stunned for 1 round.</text>
		<text>	• Spells. You can cast the following spells from the weapon each once per day: earthquake, move earth, stone shape, and stoneskin. The spell save DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + the highest of your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma modifiers.</text>
