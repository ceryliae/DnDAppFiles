		<text>• When you cast a spell with a range of touch, another member of your Unity can deliver the spell as if they had cast the spell. That member of the Unity must be within 100 feet of you, and they must use their reaction to deliver the spell when you cast it. If the spell requires an attack roll, you use your attack modifier for the roll.</text>
		<text>• When you cast a spell of 1st level or higher on another member of your Unity that targets only one creature and doesn't have a range of self, you can also target the other member of your Unity, provided he or she is within the range of the spell.

		<text>• As an action, other members of your Unity can see through your eyes and hear what you hear until the start of their next turn, gaining the benefits of any special senses that you have. During this time, they are deaf and blind with regard to their own surroundings. This benefit can be used at any distance, even across planes, provided you are conscious and not incapacitated.</text>
