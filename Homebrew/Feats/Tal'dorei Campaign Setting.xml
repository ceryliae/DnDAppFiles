	<feat name="Cruel">
		<name>Cruel</name>
		<text>The challenges and struggles you've faced throughout your life have left you ruthless in combat, relishing in the pain you inflict.</text>
		<text>• You have a number of cruelty points equal to your proficiency modifier. Once per turn, whenever you deal damage to a creature with an attack, you can spend one cruelty point to deal an additional 1d6 damage of the attack damage type to that creature.</text>
		<text>• You can also spend one cruelty point when you score a critical hit against a creature to regain 1d6 hit points.</text>
		<text>• While making a Charisma (Intimidation) check that involves inflicting pain, you can spend one cruelty point to gain advantage on the roll.</text>
		<text>• You regain your expended cruelty points when you finish a long rest.</text>
	</feat>
	<feat name="Dual-Focused">
		<name>Dual-Focused</name>
		<prerequisite>The ability to cast at least one spell</prerequisite>
		<text>Countless hours have been spent training your mind to maintain focus on concurrent incantations, taxing as the process may be.</text>
		<text>• If you attempt to cast a spell that requires concentration while already concentrating on an existing spell, you can maintain concentration on both spells simultaneously.</text>
		<text>• If you take damage during this time, you must make a concentration check for each spell individually.</text>
		<text>• At the end of each turn where you have two spells you are concentrating on, you must make a Constitution saving throw (DC equals 8 + both spells' levels combined). On a success, you maintain concentration on both spells. On a failure, you lose concentration on both spells.</text>
	</feat>
	<feat name="Flash Recall">
		<name>Flash Recall</name>
		<prerequisite>The ability to prepare spells, and cast at least one spell</prerequisite>
		<text>You've developed the ability to instantly recall an unprepared spell in moments of sudden necessity. As an action, you can instantly prepare a spell from your available class spell list (or spellbook, if you prepare spells from one) that you did not have prepared. This spell choice must be of a level for which you have spell slots. You then lose preparation of a different spell of your choice of equal or higher spell level.</text>
		<text>	If you are multiclassed, you can only Flash Recall spells from a class that prepares spells. Once you use this ability, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again.</text>
	</feat>

		<text>• You gain proficiency with two types of gaming sets of your choice.</text>

		<text>• You have a reputation as a card shark in some circles. Some folks may avoid playing you for this reason, while other higher-stakes gamblers may seek you out specifically.</text>
		<text>• When you take the Carousing downtime action, you may reroll your result once, but must keep the results of the second roll.</text>

	<feat name="Spelldriver">
		<name>Spelldriver</name>
		<prerequisite>Character level 8th or higher</prerequisite>
		<text>Through intense focus, training, and dedication, you've harnessed the techniques of rapid spellcasting. You are no longer limited to only one non-cantrip spell per turn. However, should you cast two or more spells in a single turn, only one of them can be of 3rd level or higher.</text>
	</feat>
	<feat name="Thrown Arms Master">
		<name>Thrown Arms Master</name>
		<text>You've honed your ability to lob weaponry into the fray, including weapons not meant for ranged combat. You gain the following benefits:</text>
		<text>• Increase your Strength or Dexterity score by 1, to a maximum of 20.</text>

	<feat name="Journeyman Conductor">

		<text>• You learn 2 conducting techniques of your choice from among those available to the College of the Maestro in the bard class. If a technique you use requires your target to make a saving throw to resist the technique's effects, the saving throw DC equals 8 + proficiency bonus + you Charisma Modifier.</text>
		<text>• If you already have Bardic Inspiration dice, you gain one more; otherwise you have one Bardic Inspiration die, which is a d6. This die can be given to others as a bonus action (per the bard feature, Bardic Inspiration), or can be used to fuel your technique. A Bardic Inspiration die is expended when you use it. You regain this expended bardic inspiration die when you finish a short or long rest.</text>
