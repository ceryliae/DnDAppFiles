			<name>Ability Score Increase</name>
			<text>Your Charisma score increases by 2, and either your Dexterity or your Intelligence increases by 1 (your choice).</text>
		</trait>
		<trait>
			<name>Change Appearance</name>
			<text>As an action, you can transform your appearance or revert to your natural form. You can’t duplicate the appearance of a creature you’ve never seen, and you revert to your natural form if you die.</text>
			<text>	You decide what you look like, including your height, weight, facial features, the sound of your voice, coloration, hair length, sex, and any other distinguishing characteristics. You can make yourself appear as a member of another race, though none of your game statistics change. You also can’t appear as a creature of a different size than you, and your basic shape stays the same; if you’re bipedal, you can’t use this trait to become quadrupedal, for instance. Your clothing and other equipment don’t change in appearance, size, or shape to match your new form, requiring you to keep a few extra out ts on hand to make the most compelling disguise possible.</text>
			<text>	Even to the most astute observers, your ruse is usually indiscernible. If you rouse suspicion, or if a wary creature suspects something is amiss, you have advantage on any Charisma (Deception) check you make to avoid detection.</text>

		</trait>
		<trait>
			<name>Divergent Persona</name>
			<text>You gain proficiency with one tool of your choice. De ne a unique identity associated with that proficiency; establish the name, race, gender, age, and other details.

		</trait>
		<trait>
			<name>Severed from Dreams</name>
			<text>Kalashtar sleep, but they don’t connect to the plane of dreams as other creatures do. Instead, their minds draw from the memories of their otherworldly spirit while they sleep. As such, you are immune to magical spells and effects that require you to dream, like the dream spell, but not to spells and effects that put you to sleep, like the sleep spell.</text>
