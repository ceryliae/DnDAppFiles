		<text>An energy cell of slaying is magic ammunition meant to slay a particular kind of creature. Some are more focused than others; for example, there are both energy cells of dragon slaying and energy cells of blue dragon slaying. If a creature belonging to the type, race, or group associated with an energy cell of slaying takes damage from the energy cell's weapon, the creature must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw, taking an extra 6d10 damage of the weapon's type on a failed save, or half as much extra damage on a successful one.</text>
