By holding the shard and concentrating, you can see its pages in your mind's eye. Thinking of a particular phrase or topic will draw you to the first section that addresses it, and a simple ritual allows you to add content to the shard.</text>
		<text>	A wizard can use a spellshard instead of a spellbook; the spellshard costs 1 gp per "page" in the shard, and otherwise functions as a mundane spellbook. Spellshards can also be used as diaries or journals. More advanced (and uncommon) shards can require a particular mental passphrase to access the contents of the shard.</text>

This field blocks all forms of conjuration magic and any other effect that involves teleportation or planar travel. It also negates the effects of any manifest zone within the field.</text>
		<text>	Dimensional seals are usually found in the Eldeen Reaches and the Shadow Marches, as relics of the conflict between the Gatekeeper druids and the daelkyr. The techniques used to create these seals have been long lost. It's said that as a whole, the dimensional seals keep the daelkyr bound in Khyber and prevent Xoriat from becoming coterminous with Eberron. If enough of these seals are destroyed, there could be serious consequences for the world.</text>

On a failed save, the target is affected by a suggestion compelling them to follow your command. This effect doesn't require concentration; it lasts for eight hours, until you choose to end it, or until the victim successfully fulfils the command, whichever comes first.

		<text>This device creates an antimagic field that covers a three-mile radius around the spell sink. The form that it takes will depend on the nature of its creator. The Ashbound druids despise unnatural magic, and if they create a spell sink it will be a living artifact—a twisted tree that consumes the mystical energies around it. Conversely, a mad artificer would create a massive vessel of dragonshards and exotic metals. It might be that the sole purpose of the device is to negate magic, or it could be that it is absorbing all magical energies in the area and storing that power for a cataclysmic effect!</text>

Storm spires allow House Lyrandar to influence the weather, which can be a boon for the local population or a curse if the Lyrandar baron chooses to demand payment for desired conditions. You gain the following benefits while you are attuned to a storm spire.</text>
		<text>• You can sense weather patterns within a 100-mile radius of the spire and accurately predict the weather for up to 24 hours</text>
		<text>• While you are within 60 feet of the spire, you can use an action to cast any of the following spells: call lightning, gust of wind. You cast these as 5th level spells, and Intelligence is your spellcasting ability</text>
		<text>• While you are within 5 feet of the spire, you can cast control weather as a ten-minute ritual. This allows you to pick a point within 100 miles of the spire and influence the weather within a 10-mile radius of that point. Maintaining this effect requires concentration</text>
		<text>• You can also use an action to influence the weather within a ten-mile radius of the spire itself; you don't have to use concentration to maintain this effect, and you can sustain this at the same time that you're manipulating distant weather</text>

		<text>Rarity: Rare</text>

		<text>A docent is a small metal sphere, approximately 2 inches across, studded with dragonshards. Despite a strong magical aura, it has no obvious abilities. When you attune to a docent, the sphere becomes embedded in your chest and comes to life—literally.</text>
		<text>	Sentience. A docent is a sentient neutral item with an Intelligence of 16, a Wisdom of 14, and a Charisma of 14. It can perceive the world through your senses.</text>
		<text>	A docent communicates telepathically with its wielder and can speak, read, and understand Common and Giant.</text>
		<text>	Personality. A docent is designed to advise and assist the warforged it's attached to. One of the simple functions of a docent is to serve as a translator. The docent's properties are under its control, and if you have a bad relationship with your docent it may refuse to assist you... or simply lie about information that it obtains. However, if you treat your docent well it could serve as a useful ally.</text>
		<text>	The origin of docents is a great mystery. House Cannith created the  rst warforged thirty years ago. But the docents come from the distant land of Xen'drik and appear to be thousands of years old. Were they created to interface with some other form of construct? Or are the modern warforged a new interpretation of an ancient design? The docents claim to have forgotten their creators... but this is a mystery waiting to be unraveled. While all docents come from Xen'drik, some have been brought to Khorvaire by explorers and it's possible to encounter them in the Five Nations.</text>
		<text>	Languages. All docents understand Common and Giant, but a docent knows up to four additional languages. Elvish and Draconic are common options. If a docent knows less than six languages in total, it can add new languages to its repertoire after encountering them. So a docent found in Xen'drik may have never encountered a dwarf before... but after spending some time in Khorvaire studying dwarves, it could pick up the Dwarvish language.</text>
		<text>	Properties. A docent possesses up to three of the following properties:</text>
		<text>• The docent can cast the detect magic spell at will.</text>
		<text>• The docent can cast the detect evil and good spell at will.</text>
		<text>• The docent can detect any form of divination or scrying targeting it and its warforged host.</text>
		<text>• The docent has a +7 bonus to Intelligence (Arcana) checks.</text>
		<text>• The docent has a +7 bonus to Intelligence (History) checks.</text>
		<text>• The docent has a +7 bonus to Intelligence (Investigation) checks.</text>
		<text>• The docent has a +7 bonus to Intelligence (Nature) checks.</text>
		<text>• The docent has a +6 bonus to Wisdom (Insight) checks.</text>
		<text>• The docent has a +6 bonus to Wisdom (Perception) checks.</text>
		<text>• The docent has a +6 bonus to Wisdom (Medicine) checks targeting its warforged host. If the host is rendered unconscious, the docent will automatically attempt to stabilize them once each turn.</text>
		<text>You can use a bonus action on your turn to request that the docent use one of its properties on your behalf.</text>

		<text>A wand sheath is designed to integrate with the forearm of a warforged. If you're a warforged, you can attach an wand sheath by attuning to it. While the wand sheath is attached, it cannot be removed from you against your will. You can spend one minute to end the attunement and remove the wand sheath.</text>
		<text>	You can insert a wand into the sheath as an action. While the wand is sheathed, you gain the following benefits.</text>
		<text>• You can retract the wand into your forearm or extend it from your forearm as a bonus action. While it is retracted, it cannot be damaged or removed.</text>
		<text>• While the wand is extended, you can use it as if you were holding it, but your hand remains free for other actions.</text>
		<text>• If the sheathed wand requires attunement, you must attune to the wand before you can use it. However, the wand sheath and the attached wand only count as a single item for purposes of the maximum number of items you can be attuned to. If you remove the wand from the sheath, you immediately lose your attunement to the wand.</text>

If you have multiple possible targets, you attack one at random. You are berserk until you start your turn with no creatures within 60 feet of you that you can see or hear.</text>

		<text>	This javelin is a magic weapon. When you hurl it and speak its command word, it transforms into a bolt of lightning, forming a line 5 feet wide that extends out from you to a target within 120 feet. Each creature in the line excluding you and the target must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, taking 4d6 lightning damage on a failed save, and half as much damage on a successful one. The lightning bolt turns back into a javelin when it reaches the target. Make a ranged weapon attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes damage from the javelin plus 4d6 lightning damage.</text>
		<text>The javelin's property can't be used again until the next dawn. In the meantime, the javelin can still be used as a magic weapon.</text>

		<text>Curse: This sword is cursed and possessed by a vengeful spirit. Becoming attuned to it extends the curse to you. As long as you remain cursed, you are unwilling to part with the sword, keeping it on your person at all times. While attuned to this weapon, you have disadvantage on attack rolls made with weapons other than this one.</text>
		<text>In addition, while the sword is on your person, you must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw whenever you take damage in combat. On a failed save you must attack the creature that damaged you until you drop to 0 hit points or it does, or until you can't reach the creature to make a melee attack against it.</text>
		<text>You can break the curse in the usual ways. Alternatively, casting banishment on the sword forces the vengeful spirit to leave it. The sword then becomes a +1 weapon with no other properties.</text>

At the start of each of the wounded creature's turns, it takes 1d4 necrotic damage for each time you've wounded it, and it can then make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, ending the effect of all such wounds on itself on a success. Alternatively, the wounded creature, or a creature within 5 feet of it, can use an action to make a DC 15 Wisdom (Medicine) check, ending the effect of such wounds on it on a success.</text>

		<text>	This magic weapon has 3 charges. While holding it, you can use an action and expend 1 charge to release a wave of terror. Each creature of your choice in a 30-foot radius extending from you must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of you for 1 minute. While it is frightened in this way, a creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can't willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can't take reactions. For its action it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If it has nowhere it can move, the creature can use the Dodge action. At the end of each of its turns, a creature can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.</text>

		<text>Kavan was a ruthless chieftain whose tribe lived in the Balinok Mountains centuries before the arrival of Strahd von Zarovich. Although he was very much alive, Kavan had some traits in common with vampires: he slept during the day and hunted at night, he drank the blood of his prey, and he lived underground. In battle, he wielded a spear stained with blood. His was the first blood spear, a weapon that drains life from those it kills and transfers that life to its wielder, imbuing that individual with the stamina to keep fighting.</text>
		<text>	When you hit with a melee attack using this magic spear and reduce the target to 0 hit points, you gain 2d6 temporary hit points.</text>

In the hands of its intended wielder, the mind blade is a magic weapon that deals an extra 2d6 psychic damage to any target it hits.</text>
