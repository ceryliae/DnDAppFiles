		<text>Requires attunement by a creature of non-evil alignment</text>
		<text/>
		<text>Lost for ages in the Underdark, Dawnbringer appears to be a gilded longsword hilt. While grasping the hilt, you can use a bonus action to make a blade of pure radiance spring from the hilt, or cause the blade to disappear. While the blade exists, this magic longsword has the finesse property. If you are proficient with shortswords or longswords, you are proficient with Dawnbringer.</text>
		<text>You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this weapon, which deals radiant damage instead of slashing damage. When you hit an undead with it, that target takes an extra 1d8 radiant damage.</text>
		<text>The sword's luminous blade emits bright light in a 15-foot radius and dim light for an additional 15 feet. The light is sunlight. While the blade persists, you can use an action to expand or reduce its radius of bright and dim light by 5 feet each, to a maximum of 30 feet each or a minimum of 10 feet each.</text>
		<text/>
		<text>While holding the weapon, you can use an action to touch a creature with the blade and cast lesser restoration on that creature. Once used, this ability can't be used again until the next dawn.</text>
		<text/>
		<text>Sentience: Dawnbringer is a sentient neutral good weapon with an Intelligence of 12, a Wisdom of 15, and a Charisma of 14. It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 120 feet.</text>
		<text>	The sword can speak, read, and understand Common, and it can communicate with its wielder telepathically. Its voice is kind and feminine. It knows every language you know while attuned to it.</text>
		<text/>
		<text>Personality: Forged by ancient sun worshippers, Dawnbringer is meant to bring light into darkness and to fight creatures of darkness. It is kind and compassionate to those in need, but fierce and destructive to its enemies.</text>
		<text>Long years lost in darkness have made Dawnbringer frightened of both the dark and abandonment. It prefers that its blade always be present and shedding light in areas of darkness, and it strongly resists being parted from its wielder for any length of time.</text>
		<text/>
		<text>Finesse: When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.</text>
		<text/>
		<text>Versatile: This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property â€” the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.</text>

		<text>An obsidian spell gem can contain one cantrip from any class's spell list. You become aware of the spell when you learn the gem's properties. While holding the gem, you can cast the spell from it as an action if you know the spell or if the spell is on your class's spell list. Doing so doesn't require any components, and doesn't require attunement. The spell then disappears from the gem.</text>
		<text>	An obsidian spell gem can only store cantrips. Cantrips cast from the spell gem have a save DC of 13 and an attack bonus of +5.</text>
		<text>	You can imbue the gem with a spell if you're attuned to it and it's empty. To do so, you cast the spell while holding the gem. The spell is stored in the gem instead of having any effect. Casting the spell must require either 1 action or 1 minute or longer, and the spell's level must be no higher than the gem's maximum. IF the spell belongs to the school of abjuration and requires material components that are consumed, you must provide them, but they can be worth half as much as normal.</text>
		<text>	Once imbued with a spell, the gem can't be imbued again until the next dawn.</text>

		<text/>
		<text>Crafted by the drow, this slim black wand has 7 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 of its charges to cause a small glob of viscous material to launch from the tip at one creature within 60 feet of you. Make a ranged attack roll against the target, with a bonus equal to your spellcasting modifier (or your Intelligence modifier, if you don't have a spellcasting modifier) plus your proficiency bonus. On a hit, the glob expands and dries on the target, which is restrained for 1 hour. After that time, the viscous material cracks and falls away.</text>
		<text>	Applying a pint or more of alcohol to the restrained creature dissolves the glob instantly, as does the application of oil of etherealness or universal solvent. The glob also dissolves instantly if exposed to sunlight. No other nonmagical process can remove the viscous material until it deteriorates on its own.</text>
		<text>	The wand regains 1d6 + 1 expended charges daily at midnight. If you expend the wands last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the wand melts into harmless slime and is destroyed.</text>
