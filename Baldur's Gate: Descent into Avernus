			<name>Sibriex</name>
			<text>Thought to be as old as the Abyss itself, sibriexes haunt remote parts of the plane, where they use their vile abilities to breed new horrors and apprehend forbidden lore. Rivulets of blood and bile cascade from a sibriex’s body. Where these noxious fluids hit the ground, the landscape becomes polluted.
Keepers of Forbidden Lore. Sibriexes have spent eons amassing information from across the planes, hoarding knowledge for when it might be useful. Such is their incredible intellect that many seek them out, including demon lords. Some sibriexes act as advisors and oracles, manipulating demons into serving their ends, while other sibriexes cling to their secrets, parceling out lore only when doing so would advance their plans.
Demon Crafters. Sibriexes can channel the power of the Abyss to create new demons from other creatures. Over the course of days, they can create vast numbers of rutterkins to protect their lands and to ensure that the plane teems with destructive monsters. Some demons petition sibriexes for physical gifts, and if they are moved to do so, sibriexes can graft on new body parts to give the demons greater strength, vision, or stamina. Sibriexes never give aid freely; they demand a service or a treasure in return for the flesh-shaping they provide.
Variant: Flesh Warping
Creatures that encounter a sibriex can be twisted beyond recognition. Whenever a creature fails a saving throw against the sibriex’s Warp Creature effect, you can roll percentile dice and consult the Flesh Warping table to determine an additional effect, which vanishes when Warp Creature ends on the creature. If the creature transforms into an abyssal wretch, the effect becomes a permanent feature of that body.
A creature can willingly submit to flesh warping, an agonizing process that takes at least 1 hour while the creature stays within 30 feet of the sibriex. At the end of the process, roll once on the table (or choose one effect) to determine how the creature is transformed permanently.</text>

			<name>Description</name>
			<text>A Devil's Ride is a two-wheeled infernal war machine that handles like a motorcycle. It has spiked wheels, a screaming engine, and a cowl shaped vaguely like a grinning devil's visage, with horns for handle bars. What the vehicle lacks in weapons, it makes up for with speed and maneuverability.</text>
		</trait>
		<trait>
			<name>Capacity</name>
			<text>Creature Capacity: 1 medium creature
Cargo Capacity: 100 lb</text>
		</trait>
		<trait>
			<name>Magical Elements</name>
			<text>An infernal war machine's engine, furnace, and weapons are magical and become in operable within an antimagic field. When the engine or furnace comes into contact with such an effect, the infernal war machine shuts down and can't be restarted until both the engine and the furnace are free of the field.</text>
		</trait>
		<trait>
			<name>Opportunity Attacks</name>
			<text>Infernal war machines provoke opportunity attacks as normal. When an infernal war machine provokes an opportunity attack, the attacker can target the vehicle or any creature riding on or inside it that doesn't have total cover and is within reach.</text>
		</trait>
		<trait>
			<name>Helm</name>
			<text>The helm of an infernal war machine is a chair with a wheel. levers, pedals, and other controls. The helm requires a driver to operate. An infernal war machine with no driver automatically fails Dexterity saving throws. A driver proficient with land vehicles can add its proficiency bonus to ability checks and saving throws made using the infernal war machine's ability scores.Drive. While the infernal war mac hine's engine is on, the driver can use an action to propel the vehicle up to its speed or bring the vehicle to a dead stop. While the vehicle is moving, the driver can steer it along any course.
If the driver is incapacitated, leaves the helm, or does nothing to alter the infernal war machine's course and speed, the vehicle moves in the same direction and at the same speed as it did during the driver's last turn until it hits an obstacle big enough to stop it.
Bonus A ctions. As a bonus action, the driver can do one of the following:
• Start the infernal war machine's engine or shut it off.
• Cause the infernal war machine to take the Dash or Disengage action while the vehicle's engine is running.
• Insert a soul coin or pour a flask of demon ichor into the engine's furnace (see "Soul Fuel'" and "Demon Ichor Boost" below).</text>
		</trait>

		<trait>
			<name>Weapon Stations</name>
			<text>Each of an infernal war machine's weapons takes up a station on the vehicle. One weapon can be replaced with another (see "Alternative Weapon Stations," page 221 BG:DiA), provided the crew requirement needed to operate the replacement weapon is the same.</text>
		</trait>
		<trait>
			<name>Soul Fuel</name>
			<text>The engine at the heart of every infernal war machine has a furnace fueled by soul coins (see page 225). Among the vehicle's helm controls is a narrow slot into which soul coins can be fed. Soul coins placed in this slot tumble into the furnace, which is two size categories smaller than the vehicle containing it. An infernal war machine's furnace consumes a soul coin instantly, expending all the coin's remaining charges at once and destroying the coin in the process. The soul trapped in the coin becomes trapped in the furnace instead, powering th e infernal war machine for a duration determined by how many charges the soul coin had when it was consumed: 1 charge, 24 hours; 2 charges, 48 hours; 3 charges, 72 hours. If it's still trapped in the furnace when this duration ends, the soul is destroyed. Not even divine intervention can restore a soul destroyed in this manner. Regardless of its size, a furna ce can hold any number of souls, their screams of anguish audible out to a range of 60 feet. Each new soul fed to the furnace adds more fuel to the vehicle, allowing it to run longer.</text>
		</trait>
		<trait>
			<name>Demon Ichor Boost</name>
			<text>Pouring a flask of demon ichor into an infernal war machine's furnace increases the vehicle's speed by 30 feet for 1 minute. While the vehicle's speed is increased in this way, roll a d20 at the start of each of the driver's turns. On a 1. the vehicle suffers the Furnace Rupture result on the Mishaps table (page 220).</text>
		</trait>
		<trait>
			<name>Mishaps</name>
			<text>Roll on the Mishaps table when one of the following occurs
to an infernal war machine while it's in motion:
• The infernal war machine takes damage from a single source equal to or greater than its mishap threshold.
• The infernal war machine fails an ability check (or its driver faHs an ability check using the vehicle"s ability)by more than 5.
If a mishap has a repair DC, the mishap can be ended by making repairs to the vehicle (see "Repairs" below).
Mishaps Table
Engine Flare. Fire erupts from the engine and engulfs the veh i cle. Any creature that starts its turn on or inside the vehicl e takes 10 (3d6) fire damage until this mishap ends. Repair DC: 15 (Dex)
2-4 Locked Steering. The vehicle can move in a straight line only. It automatically fails Dexterity checks and Dex terity saving throws until this mishap ends. Repair DC: 15 (Str)
5-7 Furnace Rupture. The vehicle's speed decreases by 30 feet until this mishap ends. Repair DC: 15 (Str)
8-10 Weapon Malfunction. One of the vehicle's weapons (DM's choice) can't be used until this mishap ends. If the vehicle has no functioning weapons, no mishap occurs. Repair DC: 20 (Str)
11-13 Blinding Smoke. The helm station fills with smoke and is heavily obscured until this mishap ends. Any creature in the helm station is blinded by the smoke. Repair DC: 15 (Dex)
14-16 Shedding Armor. The vehicle's damage threshold is reduced by 10 until this mishap ends. Repair DC: 15 (Str)
17-19 Damaged Axle. The vehicle grinds and shakes uncontrollably. Until the mishap ends, the vehicle has disadvantage on all Dexterity checks, and all ability checks and attack rolls made by creatures on or inside the vehicle have disadvantage. Repair DC: 20 (Dex)
20 Flip. The vehicle Aips over, falls prone, and comes to a dead stop in an unoccupied space. Any unsecured creature holding on to the outside of the vehicle must succeed on a DC 20 Strength saving throw or be thrown off, landing prone in a random unoccupied space within 20 feet of the overturned vehicle. Creatures inside the vehicle fall prone and must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or take 10 (3d6) bludgeoning damage Repair DC: None.</text>
		</trait>
		<trait>
			<name>Vehicular Exhaustion</name>
			<text>The harsh conditions of the Nine Hells can cause an infernal war machine to stop functioning properly, until it eventually breaks down. Such wear and tear can be represented using exhaustion, as described in appendix A of the Player's Handbook, with these modifications:
• When an infernal war machine reaches exhaustion level 6, its hit points drop to 0, and the vehicle breaks down.
• The only way to remove the effects of exhaustion on an infernal war machine is to repair the vehicle.</text>
		</trait>
		<trait>
			<name>Repairs</name>
			<text>When an infernal war machine is damaged, suffers a mishap, or gains one or more levels of exhaustion, a creature can attempt to make repairs to the vehicle.
The creature making the repairs must meet the following criteria:
• The creature can't operate the vehicle's helm or one of its weapon stations while making repairs.
• The creature must be within reach of the damaged area in need of repair.
• The creature must have the right tools for the job (smith's tools or tinker's tools, for example). Before beginning repairs, a c reature must decide whether the repairs are aimed at ending a mishap, removing a level of exhaustion, or restoring the damaged vehicle's hit points. Each option is discussed below. 
END A MISHAP: A creature can use its action to make an ability check based on the nature of the mishap (see the Mishaps table), with disadvantage if the vehicle is moving. The creature adds its proficiency bonus to the check if it's proficient with the tools used to make the repairs. A successful check ends the mishap. A mishap with no repair DC can't be repaired.
REMOVE EXHAUSTION: If the infernal war machine has one or more levels of exhaustion, a creature can spend 1 hour or more trying to reduce the vehicle's exhaustion level. The vehicle must be stationary, and the creature must have spare parts to make the necessary repairs. After 1 hour of repair work, the creature makes a DC 15 Intelligence check, adding its proficiency bonus to the check if it's proficient with the tools used to make repairs. If the check succeeds, the vehicle's exhaustion level decreases by 1. If the check fails, the vehicle's exhaustion level remains unchanged, though the repair can be attempted again using the same replacement parts.
RESTORE HIT POINTS: If the infernal war machine has taken damage but has at least 1 hit point, a creature can spend 1 hour or more trying to patch the hull and replace damaged parts. The vehicle must be stationary, and the creature must have the spare parts to make the necessary repairs. After 1 hour of repair work, the creature makes a DC 15 Dexterity check, adding its proficiency bonus to the c h eck if it's proficient with the tools used to make repairs. If the check succeeds, the vehicle regains 2d4 + 2 hit points. 1f the check fails, the vehicle regains no hit points, but the repair can be attempted again using the same replacement parts.</text>
		</trait>
		<trait>
			<name>Crashing</name>
			<text>When an infernal war machine crashes into something that could reasonably damage it, such as an iron wall or another vehicle of its size or bigger, the infernal war machine comes to a sudden stop and takes ld6 bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet it moved since its last turn (maximum 20d6). Whatever the vehicle struck takes the same amount of damage. If this damage is less than the infernal war machine's damage threshold, the vehicle takes no damage from the crash. Regardless of whether or not the infernal war machine takes damage, each creature on or inside the vehicle when it crashes must make a DC 15 Strength saving throw, taking ld6 bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet the vehicle moved since its last turn (maximum 20d6), or half as much damage on a successful save.
CRASHING INTO CREATURES: An infernal war machine can crash into a creature by entedng its space. The creature can use its reaction to attempt to get out of the vehicle's way, doing so and taking no damage with a successful DC 10 Dexterity saving throw. If the saving throw fails, the vehicle slams into the creature and deals ld6 bludgeoning damage to the creature for every 10 feet the vehicle moved since its last turn (maximum 20d6). An infernal war machine that is at least two size categories bigger than the creature it crashed into can continue moving through that creature's space if the infernal war machine has any movement left. Otherwise, the vehicle comes to a sudden stop, and each creature on or inside the infernal war machine when it crashes must make a DC 15 Strength saving throw, taking ld6 bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet the vehicle moved since its last turn (maximum 20d6), or half as much damage on a successful save.</text>
		</trait>
		<trait>
			<name>Falling</name>
			<text>When an infernal war machine goes over a cliff or otherwise falls, the vehicle and all creatures on or inside it take damage from the fall as normal (ld6 bludgeoning damage per 10 feet fallen, maximum 20d6) and land prone.</text>
		</trait>
		<trait>
			<name>Fiendish Variations</name>
			<text>Devils work tirelessly to create new and more powerful engines of war to stem the demonic tides flowing out of the Abyss. fn addition, infernal war machines can be equipped with more unusual weapons and armor.
Alternative Weapons Stations: One weapon station can be switched for another, but the infernal war machine can't have more weapon stations than it normally has. A handful of alternative weapon stations are described in this section.</text>
		</trait>
		<trait>
			<name>Acidic Bile Sprayer</name>
			<text>This hose weapon is attached to demonic organs that produce an acidic bile that dissolves flesh on contact.
Acidic Bile Sprayer (Requires 1 Crew and Grants Half Cover, Recharge 5-6). Acidic bile sprays from a nozzle in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in the cone must make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw, taking 40 (9d8) acid damage on a fa iled save, or ha lf as much damage on a successful one. A creature reduced to 0 hit points by this damage is dissolved, leaving behind any objects it was carrying or wearing.</text>
		</trait>
		<trait>
			<name>Flamethrower</name>
			<text>Although useless against demons, this weapon is great against flammable creatures and objects.
Flamethrower (Requires 1 Crew and Grants Half Cover). Fire shoots out of the weapon's nozzle in a 60-foot line that is 5 feet wide. Each creature in the line must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 18 (4d8) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The fi re ignites any flammable objects in the area that aren't being carried or worn.</text>
		</trait>
		<trait>
			<name>Infernal Screamer</name>
			<text>A writhing humanoid torso made of melting wax juts out from this station, with a barbed hand crank between its shoulder blades. The figure telepathically shrieks in agony when the crank is turned.
Infernal Screamer (Requires 1 Crew and Grants Half Cover). The screamer's operator ta rgets one creature it can see within 120 feet of the screamer. The target must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw, taking 26 (4dl2) psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</text>
		</trait>
		<trait>
			<name>Styx Sprayer</name>
			<text>This flexible hose is connected to a tank that holds 30 gallons of water from the River Styx. Each use of the weapon depletes 10 gallons of the water. Refilling the tank requires access to the Styx.
Styx Sprayer (Requires 1 Crew and Grants Half Cover; 3 Uses). Ranged Spell Attack: +5 to hit, range 30 ft., one creature. Hit: The creature is struck by water from the River Styx and targeted by a feeblemind spell (save DC 20). An already feebleminded creature is immune to this effect, as is a creature adapted to the River Styx. If the target fails its saving throw and the spell's effect on it is not ended within 30 days, the effect becomes permanent, whereupon the creature loses all its memories and becomes a near-mindless shell of its former sel f. At that point, nothing short of divine intervention can undo the effect.</text>
		</trait>
		<trait>
			<name>Armor Upgrades</name>
			<text>An infernal war machine can receive one armor upgrade. Sample upgrades are described below.</text>
		</trait>
		<trait>
			<name>Canian Armor</name>
			<text>The infernal iron used to make the vehicle was mined on Cania, the coldest layer of the Nine Hells. An infernal war machine with Canian armor has an Armor Class of 22 + its Dexterity modifier. While the vehicle is not moving, attack rolls made against it have advantage. The infernal war machine also has immunity to cold damage in addition to its other damage immunities, and it's immune to the effects of extreme cold.</text>
		</trait>
		<trait>
			<name>Gilded Death Armor</name>
			<text>Gold stolen or bartered from the archdevil Mammon plates the vehicle's exterior. This gold can't be removed without destroying the vehicle and turns to dust when the infernal war machine drops to 0 hit points. Gilded death armor grants the infernal war machine resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.</text>
		</trait>
		<trait>
			<name>Soul Spike Armor</name>
			<text>The vehicle is covered with spikes inscribed with blasphemous symbols. Luminous, ghostly figures impaled on these spikes wail and reach out in agony. If a creature that isn't a devil dies within 30 feet of the infernal war machine, its soul (if it has one) is torn from its body and joins the wailing throng impaled on the spikes. As long as its soul remains trapped, a creature can't be raised from the dead by any means. A trapped soul is freed if the vehicle is destroyed, if the spike anchoring it is the target of a remove curse spell or similar magic, or if the spike is destroyed. Each spike is a Small object with AC 19, 15 hit points, and resistance to all damage except radiant damage.</text>

			<text>The helm of an infernal war machine is a chair with a wheel. levers, pedals, and other controls. The helm requires a driver to operate. An infernal war machine with no driver automatically fails Dexterity saving throws. A driver proficient with land vehicles can add its proficiency bonus to ability checks and saving throws made using the infernal war machine's ability scores.Drive. While the infernal war mac hine's engine is on, the driver can use an action to propel the vehicle up to its speed or bring the vehicle to a dead stop.

Bonus A ctions. As a bonus action, the driver can do one of the following:
• Start the infernal war machine's engine or shut it off.
• Cause the infernal war machine to take the Dash or Disengage action while the vehicle's engine is running.

An infernal war machine's furnace consumes a soul coin instantly, expending all the coin's remaining charges at once and destroying the coin in the process. The soul trapped in the coin becomes trapped in the furnace instead, powering th e infernal war machine for a duration determined by how many charges the soul coin had when it was consumed: 1 charge, 24 hours; 2 charges, 48 hours; 3 charges, 72 hours. If it's still trapped in the furnace when this duration ends, the soul is destroyed. Not even divine intervention can restore a soul destroyed in this manner. Regardless of its size, a furna ce can hold any number of souls, their screams of anguish audible out to a range of 60 feet.

to an infernal war machine while it's in motion:
• The infernal war machine takes damage from a single source equal to or greater than its mishap threshold.
• The infernal war machine fails an ability check (or its driver faHs an ability check using the vehicle"s ability)by more than 5.
If a mishap has a repair DC, the mishap can be ended by making repairs to the vehicle (see "Repairs" below).
Mishaps Table
Engine Flare. Fire erupts from the engine and engulfs the veh i cle. Any creature that starts its turn on or inside the vehicl e takes 10 (3d6) fire damage until this mishap ends. Repair DC: 15 (Dex)
2-4 Locked Steering. The vehicle can move in a straight line only. It automatically fails Dexterity checks and Dex terity saving throws until this mishap ends. Repair DC: 15 (Str)
5-7 Furnace Rupture. The vehicle's speed decreases by 30 feet until this mishap ends. Repair DC: 15 (Str)
8-10 Weapon Malfunction. One of the vehicle's weapons (DM's choice) can't be used until this mishap ends. If the vehicle has no functioning weapons, no mishap occurs. Repair DC: 20 (Str)

			<name>Vehicular Exhaustion</name>
			<text>The harsh conditions of the Nine Hells can cause an infernal war machine to stop functioning properly, until it eventually breaks down. Such wear and tear can be represented using exhaustion, as described in appendix A of the Player's Handbook, with these modifications:
• When an infernal war machine reaches exhaustion level 6, its hit points drop to 0, and the vehicle breaks down.
• The only way to remove the effects of exhaustion on an infernal war machine is to repair the vehicle.</text>
		</trait>
		<trait>
			<name>Repairs</name>
			<text>When an infernal war machine is damaged, suffers a mishap, or gains one or more levels of exhaustion, a creature can attempt to make repairs to the vehicle.
The creature making the repairs must meet the following criteria:
• The creature can't operate the vehicle's helm or one of its weapon stations while making repairs.
• The creature must be within reach of the damaged area in need of repair.
• The creature must have the right tools for the job (smith's tools or tinker's tools, for example). Before beginning repairs, a c reature must decide whether the repairs are aimed at ending a mishap, removing a level of exhaustion, or restoring the damaged vehicle's hit points. Each option is discussed below. 
END A MISHAP: A creature can use its action to make an ability check based on the nature of the mishap (see the Mishaps table), with disadvantage if the vehicle is moving. The creature adds its proficiency bonus to the check if it's proficient with the tools used to make the repairs. A successful check ends the mishap. A mishap with no repair DC can't be repaired.
REMOVE EXHAUSTION: If the infernal war machine has one or more levels of exhaustion, a creature can spend 1 hour or more trying to reduce the vehicle's exhaustion level. The vehicle must be stationary, and the creature must have spare parts to make the necessary repairs. After 1 hour of repair work, the creature makes a DC 15 Intelligence check, adding its proficiency bonus to the check if it's proficient with the tools used to make repairs. If the check succeeds, the vehicle's exhaustion level decreases by 1. If the check fails, the vehicle's exhaustion level remains unchanged, though the repair can be attempted again using the same replacement parts.
RESTORE HIT POINTS: If the infernal war machine has taken damage but has at least 1 hit point, a creature can spend 1 hour or more trying to patch the hull and replace damaged parts. The vehicle must be stationary, and the creature must have the spare parts to make the necessary repairs. After 1 hour of repair work, the creature makes a DC 15 Dexterity check, adding its proficiency bonus to the c h eck if it's proficient with the tools used to make repairs. If the check succeeds, the vehicle regains 2d4 + 2 hit points. 1f the check fails, the vehicle regains no hit points, but the repair can be attempted again using the same replacement parts.</text>

		<trait>
			<name>Crashing</name>
			<text>When an infernal war machine crashes into something that could reasonably damage it, such as an iron wall or another vehicle of its size or bigger, the infernal war machine comes to a sudden stop and takes ld6 bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet it moved since its last turn (maximum 20d6). Whatever the vehicle struck takes the same amount of damage. If this damage is less than the infernal war machine's damage threshold, the vehicle takes no damage from the crash. Regardless of whether or not the infernal war machine takes damage, each creature on or inside the vehicle when it crashes must make a DC 15 Strength saving throw, taking ld6 bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet the vehicle moved since its last turn (maximum 20d6), or half as much damage on a successful save.
CRASHING INTO CREATURES: An infernal war machine can crash into a creature by entedng its space. The creature can use its reaction to attempt to get out of the vehicle's way, doing so and taking no damage with a successful DC 10 Dexterity saving throw. If the saving throw fails, the vehicle slams into the creature and deals ld6 bludgeoning damage to the creature for every 10 feet the vehicle moved since its last turn (maximum 20d6). An infernal war machine that is at least two size categories bigger than the creature it crashed into can continue moving through that creature's space if the infernal war machine has any movement left. Otherwise, the vehicle comes to a sudden stop, and each creature on or inside the infernal war machine when it crashes must make a DC 15 Strength saving throw, taking ld6 bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet the vehicle moved since its last turn (maximum 20d6), or half as much damage on a successful save.</text>

			<name>Styx Sprayer</name>
			<text>This flexible hose is connected to a tank that holds 30 gallons of water from the River Styx. Each use of the weapon depletes 10 gallons of the water. Refilling the tank requires access to the Styx.
Styx Sprayer (Requires 1 Crew and Grants Half Cover; 3 Uses). Ranged Spell Attack: +5 to hit, range 30 ft., one creature. Hit: The creature is struck by water from the River Styx and targeted by a feeblemind spell (save DC 20). An already feebleminded creature is immune to this effect, as is a creature adapted to the River Styx. If the target fails its saving throw and the spell's effect on it is not ended within 30 days, the effect becomes permanent, whereupon the creature loses all its memories and becomes a near-mindless shell of its former sel f. At that point, nothing short of divine intervention can undo the effect.</text>

			<name>Vehicular Exhaustion</name>
			<text>The harsh conditions of the Nine Hells can cause an infernal war machine to stop functioning properly, until it eventually breaks down. Such wear and tear can be represented using exhaustion, as described in appendix A of the Player's Handbook, with these modifications:
• When an infernal war machine reaches exhaustion level 6, its hit points drop to 0, and the vehicle breaks down.
• The only way to remove the effects of exhaustion on an infernal war machine is to repair the vehicle.</text>
		</trait>
		<trait>
			<name>Repairs</name>
			<text>When an infernal war machine is damaged, suffers a mishap, or gains one or more levels of exhaustion, a creature can attempt to make repairs to the vehicle.
The creature making the repairs must meet the following criteria:
• The creature can't operate the vehicle's helm or one of its weapon stations while making repairs.
• The creature must be within reach of the damaged area in need of repair.
• The creature must have the right tools for the job (smith's tools or tinker's tools, for example). Before beginning repairs, a c reature must decide whether the repairs are aimed at ending a mishap, removing a level of exhaustion, or restoring the damaged vehicle's hit points. Each option is discussed below. 
END A MISHAP: A creature can use its action to make an ability check based on the nature of the mishap (see the Mishaps table), with disadvantage if the vehicle is moving. The creature adds its proficiency bonus to the check if it's proficient with the tools used to make the repairs. A successful check ends the mishap. A mishap with no repair DC can't be repaired.
REMOVE EXHAUSTION: If the infernal war machine has one or more levels of exhaustion, a creature can spend 1 hour or more trying to reduce the vehicle's exhaustion level. The vehicle must be stationary, and the creature must have spare parts to make the necessary repairs. After 1 hour of repair work, the creature makes a DC 15 Intelligence check, adding its proficiency bonus to the check if it's proficient with the tools used to make repairs. If the check succeeds, the vehicle's exhaustion level decreases by 1. If the check fails, the vehicle's exhaustion level remains unchanged, though the repair can be attempted again using the same replacement parts.
RESTORE HIT POINTS: If the infernal war machine has taken damage but has at least 1 hit point, a creature can spend 1 hour or more trying to patch the hull and replace damaged parts. The vehicle must be stationary, and the creature must have the spare parts to make the necessary repairs. After 1 hour of repair work, the creature makes a DC 15 Dexterity check, adding its proficiency bonus to the c h eck if it's proficient with the tools used to make repairs. If the check succeeds, the vehicle regains 2d4 + 2 hit points. 1f the check fails, the vehicle regains no hit points, but the repair can be attempted again using the same replacement parts.</text>

			<name>Crashing</name>
			<text>When an infernal war machine crashes into something that could reasonably damage it, such as an iron wall or another vehicle of its size or bigger, the infernal war machine comes to a sudden stop and takes ld6 bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet it moved since its last turn (maximum 20d6). Whatever the vehicle struck takes the same amount of damage. If this damage is less than the infernal war machine's damage threshold, the vehicle takes no damage from the crash. Regardless of whether or not the infernal war machine takes damage, each creature on or inside the vehicle when it crashes must make a DC 15 Strength saving throw, taking ld6 bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet the vehicle moved since its last turn (maximum 20d6), or half as much damage on a successful save.
CRASHING INTO CREATURES: An infernal war machine can crash into a creature by entedng its space. The creature can use its reaction to attempt to get out of the vehicle's way, doing so and taking no damage with a successful DC 10 Dexterity saving throw. If the saving throw fails, the vehicle slams into the creature and deals ld6 bludgeoning damage to the creature for every 10 feet the vehicle moved since its last turn (maximum 20d6). An infernal war machine that is at least two size categories bigger than the creature it crashed into can continue moving through that creature's space if the infernal war machine has any movement left. Otherwise, the vehicle comes to a sudden stop, and each creature on or inside the infernal war machine when it crashes must make a DC 15 Strength saving throw, taking ld6 bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet the vehicle moved since its last turn (maximum 20d6), or half as much damage on a successful save.</text>

An infernal war machine with Canian armor has an Armor Class of 22 + its Dexterity modifier. While the vehicle is not moving, attack rolls made against it have advantage. The infernal war machine also has immunity to cold damage in addition to its other damage immunities, and it's immune to the effects of extreme cold.</text>
		</trait>
		<trait>
			<name>Gilded Death Armor</name>
			<text>Gold stolen or bartered from the archdevil Mammon plates the vehicle's exterior. This gold can't be removed without destroying the vehicle and turns to dust when the infernal war machine drops to 0 hit points. Gilded death armor grants the infernal war machine resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.</text>
		</trait>
		<trait>
			<name>Soul Spike Armor</name>
			<text>The vehicle is covered with spikes inscribed with blasphemous symbols. Luminous, ghostly figures impaled on these spikes wail and reach out in agony. If a creature that isn't a devil dies within 30 feet of the infernal war machine, its soul (if it has one) is torn from its body and joins the wailing throng impaled on the spikes. As long as its soul remains trapped, a creature can't be raised from the dead by any means. A trapped soul is freed if the vehicle is destroyed, if the spike anchoring it is the target of a remove curse spell or similar magic, or if the spike is destroyed. Each spike is a Small object with AC 19, 15 hit points, and resistance to all damage except radiant damage.</text>

		</trait>
		<trait>
			<name>Helm</name>
			<text>The helm of an infernal war machine is a chair with a wheel. levers, pedals, and other controls. The helm requires a driver to operate. An infernal war machine with no driver automatically fails Dexterity saving throws. A driver proficient with land vehicles can add its proficiency bonus to ability checks and saving throws made using the infernal war machine's ability scores.Drive. While the infernal war mac hine's engine is on, the driver can use an action to propel the vehicle up to its speed or bring the vehicle to a dead stop. While the vehicle is moving, the driver can steer it along any course.
If the driver is incapacitated, leaves the helm, or does nothing to alter the infernal war machine's course and speed, the vehicle moves in the same direction and at the same speed as it did during the driver's last turn until it hits an obstacle big enough to stop it.
Bonus A ctions. As a bonus action, the driver can do one of the following:
• Start the infernal war machine's engine or shut it off.
• Cause the infernal war machine to take the Dash or Disengage action while the vehicle's engine is running.
• Insert a soul coin or pour a flask of demon ichor into the engine's furnace (see "Soul Fuel'" and "Demon Ichor Boost" below).</text>

		</trait>
		<trait>
			<name>Soul Fuel</name>
			<text>The engine at the heart of every infernal war machine has a furnace fueled by soul coins (see page 225). Among the vehicle's helm controls is a narrow slot into which soul coins can be fed. Soul coins placed in this slot tumble into the furnace, which is two size categories smaller than the vehicle containing it. An infernal war machine's furnace consumes a soul coin instantly, expending all the coin's remaining charges at once and destroying the coin in the process. The soul trapped in the coin becomes trapped in the furnace instead, powering th e infernal war machine for a duration determined by how many charges the soul coin had when it was consumed: 1 charge, 24 hours; 2 charges, 48 hours; 3 charges, 72 hours. If it's still trapped in the furnace when this duration ends, the soul is destroyed. Not even divine intervention can restore a soul destroyed in this manner. Regardless of its size, a furna ce can hold any number of souls, their screams of anguish audible out to a range of 60 feet. Each new soul fed to the furnace adds more fuel to the vehicle, allowing it to run longer.</text>

		<trait>
			<name>Armor Upgrades</name>
			<text>An infernal war machine can receive one armor upgrade. Sample upgrades are described below.</text>
		</trait>
		<trait>
			<name>Canian Armor</name>
			<text>The infernal iron used to make the vehicle was mined on Cania, the coldest layer of the Nine Hells. An infernal war machine with Canian armor has an Armor Class of 22 + its Dexterity modifier. While the vehicle is not moving, attack rolls made against it have advantage. The infernal war machine also has immunity to cold damage in addition to its other damage immunities, and it's immune to the effects of extreme cold.</text>
		</trait>
		<trait>
			<name>Gilded Death Armor</name>
			<text>Gold stolen or bartered from the archdevil Mammon plates the vehicle's exterior. This gold can't be removed without destroying the vehicle and turns to dust when the infernal war machine drops to 0 hit points. Gilded death armor grants the infernal war machine resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.</text>
		</trait>
		<trait>
			<name>Soul Spike Armor</name>
			<text>The vehicle is covered with spikes inscribed with blasphemous symbols. Luminous, ghostly figures impaled on these spikes wail and reach out in agony. If a creature that isn't a devil dies within 30 feet of the infernal war machine, its soul (if it has one) is torn from its body and joins the wailing throng impaled on the spikes. As long as its soul remains trapped, a creature can't be raised from the dead by any means. A trapped soul is freed if the vehicle is destroyed, if the spike anchoring it is the target of a remove curse spell or similar magic, or if the spike is destroyed. Each spike is a Small object with AC 19, 15 hit points, and resistance to all damage except radiant damage.</text>

The cloud is stationary and lasts for 1 minute. The area within it is heavily obscured. Any creature that enters the cloud for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there takes 21 (6d6) necrotic damage. A strong wind disperses the cloud. This device needs 24 hours to recharge before it can be used again.</text>
		</trait>
		<trait>
			<name>Teleporter</name>
			<text>The vehicle's driver can activate this magical device as a bonus action, causing the vehicle to teleport to an unoccupied space that the driver can see up to 300 feet away from the vehicle's current position.

		<text>An infernal puzzle box is a cube-shaped container 5 to 6 inc h es on a s ide, composed of airtight, interlocking parts made from materials found in the Nine Hells. Most of these boxes are made of infernal iron, though some are carved from bone or horn. Infernal puzzle boxes are used to safeguard diaboli cal contracts signed between devils and mortals, even after the te rms of these contracts are fulfilled. An empty infernal puzzle box weighs 3 pounds regardless of the mate rials use d to fashion it. When an object small enough to fit inside an infernal puzzle box is placed in it, the c ontainer magically seals shut around the object, and no magic can force the box open. The sealed box becomes immune to all damage as well. Every infernal puzzle box is constructed with a unique means of opening it. The trick to solving the puzzle is always mundane, neve r magical. Once a creature figures out the trick or sequence of steps needed to open a partkular infernal puzzle box, that creature can open the box as an action, allowing access to the box's contents. A creature that spends 1 hour holding an infernal puzzle box while trying to open it can make a DC 30 Intelligence (Investigation) c heck. If the check succeeds, the creature figures out the trick or sequence of steps needed to open the box. If the check fails by 5 or more, the creature must make a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw, taking 42 (12d6) psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</text>

		<text>This bulky, eyeless helmet is made for a pit fiend but magically resizes to fit the heads of other wearers. While wearing the helm, you can see out of it as though you weren't wearing it. In addition, you know the exact location and type of all devils within 1,000 feet of you. You can telepathically communicate with a devil within range, or you can broadcast your thoughts to all devils within range. The devils receiving your broadcasted thoughts have no special means of replying to them. The helm has 3 charges. As an action, you can expend 1 charge to cast dominate monster (save DC 21), which affects devils only. (The spell fails and the charge is wasted if you target any c reature that's not a devil.) If a devil can see you when you c ast this spell on it, the devil knows you tried to charm it. The helm regains all its charges 24 hours after its last charge is expended. If you are not a devil, using the helm's dominate monster property in the Nine Hells has a 20 percent chance of attracting a narzugon, which arrives on the back of a nightmare mount in ld4 hours. The narzugoo tries to recove r th e h elm, killing you if necessary to obtain it. If it gets the he lm, the narzugon tries to deliver it to its infernal master.</text>

		<text>A narzugon devil binds a nightmare (described in the Monster Manual) to its service with infernal tack, which consists of a bridle, bit, reins, saddle, stirrups, and spurs. A nightmare equ.ipped with infernal tack must serve whoever wears the spurs until the wearer dies or the tack is removed. You can use an action to call the nightmare equipped with infernal tack by clashing the spurs together or scraping them through blood. The nightmare appears at the start of you r next turn, within 20 feet of you . It acts as your ally and takes its turn on your initiative count. It remains for 1 day, until you or it dies, or until you dismiss it as an action. If the nightmare dies, it reformsin the Nine Hells within 24 hours, after which you can summon it again. The tack doesn't conjure a nightmare from thin air; one must first be subdued so the tack can be placed on it. No nightmare accepts this forced servitude willingly, but some eventually form strong loyalties to their masters and become partners in evil.</text>

		<text>The Shield of the Hidden Lord is of celestial origin and serves as a prison for the pit fiend Gargauth, whose mortal followers revere it as a god. Over time, Gargauth's evil has warped the shield's appearance, so that its celestial motif and designs have become twisted into a fiendish face that subtly moves in disturbing ways. While holding this shield, you gain a +2 bonus to AC and resistance to fire damage.
Sentience. The Shield of the Hidden Lord is sentient as long as it imprisons Gargauth. While sentient, the shield has the following properties:
The shield has an Intelligence of 22, a Wisdom of 18, and a Charisma of 24, as well as hearing and truesight out to a range of 120 feet.
The shield can speak, read, and understand Common and Infernal, and it can communicate telepathically with any creature it can sense within 120 feet of it. Its voice is a deep, hollow whisper.
The shield has 3 charges. You can use an action to expend 1 charge to cast fireball or 2 charges to cast wall of fire from the shield (save DC 21 for each). The wall of fire spell lasts for 1 minute (no concentration required). The shield regains all expended charges daily at dawn.
Anytime during your turn, the shield can choose to radiate an aura of dread for 1 minute. (This is not a power of the shield that you control.) Any creature hostile to you that starts its turn within 20 feet of the shield must make a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is frightened until the start of its next turn. On a successful save, the creature is immune to this power of the shield for the next 24 hours. Once the shield uses this power, it can't use it again until the next dawn. 
Gargauth's Personality. Gargauth desperately seeks freedom but can't escape on its own. The pit fiend won't reveal its true nature, referring to itself only as the Hidden Lord. It drops hints and subtle suggestions that it is an angel trapped in an unholy prison. If released from the shield, the pit fiend honors the terms of whatever bargain it struck to facilitate its escape. While trapped in the shield, Gargauth carefully steers the shield's current owner toward committing acts of cruelty and domination, hoping to condemn the individual's soul to the Nine Hells. Conflict occurs if the shield's owner does anything that would make it more difficult for Gargauth to escape its prison, such as leaving the shield in a place where others are unlikely to find it. Gargauth doesn't know how to escape from the shield. The pit fiend believes (incorrectly) that it can break free of the shield if it's brought to the Nine Hells, for it's convinced that the shield's powers are weaker there. 
Freeing Gargauth. Casting dispel evil and good on the shield has a 1 percent chance of freeing the pit fiend, or automatically succeeds if the spell is cast by a solar, a planetar, or an archdevil. A god can release the pit fiend by touching the shield and speaking Gargauth's name. When released, Gargauth appears in a random, unoccupied space as close to the shield as possible.</text>

		<text>Soul coins are about 5 inches across and about an inch thick, minted from infernal iron. Each coin weighs one third of a pound, and is inscribed with Infernal writing and a spell that magically binds a single soul to the coin. Because each soul coin has a unique soul trapped within it, each has a story. A creature might have been imprisoned as a result of defaulting on a deal, while another might be the victim of a night hag's curse.
Carrying Soul Coins. To hold a soul coin is to feel the soul bound within it- overcome with rage or fraught with despair.
An evil creature can carry as many soul coins as it wishes (up to its maximum weight allowance). A nonevil creature can carry a number of soul coins equal to or less than its Constitution modifier without penalty. A non-evil creature carrying a number of soul coins greater than its Constitution modifier has disadvantage on its attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws.
Using a Soul Coin. A soul coin has 3 charges. A creature carrying the coin can use its action to expend 1 charge from a soul coin and use it to do one of the following:
Drain Life. You siphon away some of the soul's essence and gain ldlO temporary hit points.
Query. You telepathically ask the soul a question and receive a brief telepathic response. which you can understand. The soul knows on ly what it knew in life, but it must answer you truthfully and to the best of its ability. The answer is no more than a sentence or two and might be cryptic.
Freeing a Soul. Casting a spell that removes a curse on a soul coin frees the soul trapped within it, as does expending all of the coin's charges. The coin itself rusts from w ithi n and is destroyed once the soul is released. A freed soul travels to the realm of the god it served or the outer plane most closely tied to its alignment (DM's choice). The souls of lawful evil creatures released from soul coins typically emerge from the River Styx as lemure devils. 
A soul can also be freed by destroying the coin that contains it. A soul coin has AC 19, 1 hit point for each charge it has remaining, and immunity to all damage except that which is dealt by a hellfire weapon or an infernal war machine's furnace (page 217).
Freeing a soul from a soul coin is considered a good act, even if the soul belongs to an evil creature.
Hellish Currency. Soul coins are a currency of the Nine Hell s and are highly valued by devils. The coins are used among the infernal hierarchy to barter for favors, bribe the unwilling. and reward the faithful for services rendered. 
Soul coins are created by Mammon and his greater devils on Minauros, the third layer of the Nine Hells, in a vast chamber where the captured souls of evil mortals are bound into the coins. These coins are then distributed throughout the Nine Hells to be used for goods and services, infernal deals, dark bargains, and bribes.</text>
