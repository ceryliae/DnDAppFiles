		<trait>
			<name>Subrace</name>
			<text>Having met a cruel and undeserved end, you have returned to the realm of the living. As a revenant, you thirst for revenge against those who wronged you in life, or seek to complete a final, critical task you left unfinished.</text>
			<text>The revenant subrace can be applied to any race that has a subrace, and replaces that race’s existing subrace options. Alternatively, you can apply this new subrace to a race without subrace options using the modification options provided below.</text>
			<text>Your DM might also allow you to take this subrace for a slain character. In that case, your character rises from the dead with its original subrace replaced (or with the necessary modifications made to its base traits), filled with a determination to seek vengeance or complete its mission.</text>
			<text>This Subrace is from Unearthed Arcana: Gothic Heroes, and as such may not be allowed in your game. Consult your DM before selecting this option.</text>

		<trait>
			<name>Relentless Nature</name>
			<text>Your DM assigns a goal to you—typically, one related to your character’s death. The goal must be a specific task you can complete, such as slaying an enemy or liberating an area and its people. Until you fulfill that goal, you gain the following benefits:</text>
			<text>• If you are below half your hit point maximum at the start of your turn, you regain 1 hit point.</text>
			<text>• If you die, you return to life 24 hours after death. If your body is destroyed, you reform within 1 mile of the place of your death at a spot determined by the DM. If your equipment was also destroyed, you do not regain it.</text>
			<text>• You know the distance and direction between you and any creature involved in your goal, such as a person you seek vengeance against or someone you pledged to defend. This awareness fails if the creature is on another plane of existence.</text>
			<text>When your goal is complete, you finally find rest. You die and cannot be restored to life.</text>
