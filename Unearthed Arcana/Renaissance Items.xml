		<text>The ammunition of a firearm is destroyed upon use. Renaissance firearms use bullets and gunpowder.</text>
		<text>A bullet of slaying is a magic weapon meant to slay a particular kind of creature. Some are more focused than others; for example, there are both bullets of dragon slaying and bullets of blue dragon slaying. If a creature belonging to the type, race, or group associated with an arrow of slaying takes damage from the arrow, the creature must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw, taking an extra 6d10 piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much extra damage on a successful one.</text>

		<text>Gunpowder is chiefly used to propel a bullet out of the barrel of a pistol or rifle, or it is formed into a bomb. Gunpowder is sold in small wooden kegs and in water-resistant powder horns.</text>
		<text>Setting fire to a container full of gunpowder can cause it to explode, dealing fire damage to creatures within 10 feet of it (3d6 for a powder horn, 7d6 for a keg). A successful DC 12 Dexterity saving throw halves the damage.
