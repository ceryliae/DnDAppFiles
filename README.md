Files for the GM5 and Fight Club apps from Lion's Den

Please do NOT use these files unless you know what you are doing. The files here are a work in progress, and are not guaranteed to work properly when imported.

Not all files use a format consumable by GM5 and Fight Club, in particular the various files under Classes use `<subclass>` and `<spellList>` tags that compile into standard format with the `create_compendiums.py` python script.

We are not affiliated with Leo or Lion's Den in any way.
