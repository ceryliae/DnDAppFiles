# DnDAppFiles - Renewed

The original intent of this was to import DnD data in to GM5 and FightClub.

I've found many other uses for these files outside of those apps.

My primary use has been importing the comendiums into Microsoft OneNote and Trello.

Other uses:

- **Google Docs** - gm sheets
- **Microsoft Word** - make printable cards
- **PDF Building** - make full page pdf documents
- **Mardown** - use for general markdown for websites
- **Wiki Pages** - import in to wiki page
