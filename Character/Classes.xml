		<autolevel level="1">
			<feature>
				<name>Rage</name>
				<text>In battle, you fight with primal ferocity. On your turn, you can enter a rage as a bonus action.</text>
				<text>    While raging, you gain the following benefits if you aren't wearing heavy armor:</text>
				<text />
				<text>• You have advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws.</text>
				<text>• When you make a melee weapon attack using Strength, you gain a +2 bonus to the damage roll. This bonus increases as you level.</text>
				<text>• You have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.</text>
				<text />
				<text>If you are able to cast spells, you can't cast them or concentrate on them while raging.</text>
				<text>    Your rage lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if you are knocked unconscious or if your turn ends and you haven't attacked a hostile creature since your last turn or taken damage since then. You can also end your rage on your turn as a bonus action.</text>
				<text>    Once you have raged the maximum number of times for your barbarian level, you must finish a long rest before you can rage again.  You may rage 2 times at 1st level, 3 at 3rd, 4 at 6th, 5 at 12th, and 6 at 17th.</text>
			</feature>
			<feature>
				<name>Unarmored Defense</name>
				<text>While you are not wearing any armor, your Armor Class equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Constitution modifier. You can use a shield and still gain this benefit.</text>
			</feature>
		</autolevel>

		<autolevel level="2">
			<feature>
				<name>Danger Sense</name>
				<text>At 2nd level, you gain an uncanny sense of when things nearby aren't as they should be, giving you an edge when you dodge away from danger. You have advantage on Dexterity saving throws against effects that you can see, such as traps and spells. To gain this benefit, you can't be blinded, deafened, or incapacitated.</text>
			</feature>
			<feature>
				<name>Reckless Attack</name>
				<text>Starting at 2nd level, you can throw aside all concern for defense to attack with fierce desperation. When you make your first attack on your turn, you can decide to attack recklessly. Doing so gives you advantage on melee weapon attack rolls using Strength during this turn, but attack rolls against you have advantage until your next turn.</text>
			</feature>
		</autolevel>

		<autolevel level="3">
			<feature>
				<name>Increased Rages</name>
				<text>You may now rage 3 times before a long rest.</text>
			</feature>
			<feature>
				<name>Primal Path</name>
				<text>At 3rd level, you choose a path that shapes the nature of your rage. Choose the Path of the Berserker or the Path of the Totem Warrior, both detailed at the end of the class description. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th levels.</text>
			</feature>
			<feature optional="YES">
				<name>Primal Path: Path of the Berserker</name>
				<text>For some barbarians, rage is a means to an end -- that end being violence. The Path of the Berserker is a path of untrammeled fury, slick with blood. As you enter the berserker's rage, you thrill in the chaos of battle, heedless of your own health or well-being.</text>
			</feature>
			<feature optional="YES">
				<name>Primal Path: Path of the Totem Warrior</name>
				<text>The Path of the Totem Warrior is a spiritual journey, as the barbarian accepts a spirit animal as guide, protector, and inspiration. In battle, your totem spirit fills you with supernatural might, adding magical fuel to your barbarian rage.</text>
				<text />
				<text>Most barbarian tribes consider a totem animal to be kin to a particular clan. In such cases, it is unusual for an individual to have more than one totem animal spirit, though exceptions exist.</text>
			</feature>
			<feature optional="YES">
				<name>Primal Path: Path of the Battlerager</name>
				<text>Known as Kuldjargh (literally "axe idiot") in Dwarvish, battleragers are dwarf followers of the gods of war and take the Path of the Battlerager. They specialize in wearing nulky, spiked armor and throwing themselves into combat, striking with their body itself and giving themselves over to the fury of battle.</text>
			</feature>
			<feature optional="YES">
				<name>Path of the Battlerager: Restriction - Dwarves Only</name>
				<text>Only dwarves can follow the Path of the Battlerager. The battlerager fills a particular niche in dwarven society and culture.</text>
				<text />
				<text>Your DM can lift this restriction to better suite the campaign. The restriction exists for the Forgotten Realms. It might not apply to yourt DM's setting or your DM's version of the realms.</text>
			</feature>
			<feature optional="YES">
				<name>Path of the Battlerager: Battlerager Armor</name>
				<text>When you choose this path at 3rd level, you gain the ability to use spiked armor as a weapon.</text>
				<text />
				<text>While you are wearing spiked armor and are raging, you can use a bonus action to make one melee weapon attack with your armor spikes at a target within 5 feet of you. If the attack hits, the spikes deal 1d4 piercing damage. You use your Strength modifier for the attack and damage rolls.</text>
				<text />
				<text>Additionally, when you use the Attack action to grapple a creature, the target takes 3 piercing damage if your grapple check succeeds.</text>
			</feature>
			<feature optional="YES">
				<name>Path of the Berserker: Frenzy</name>
				<text>Starting when you choose this path at 3rd level, you can go into a frenzy when you rage. If you do so, for the duration of your rage you can make a single melee weapon attack as a bonus action on each of your turns after this one. When your rage ends, you suffer one level of exhaustion.</text>
			</feature>
			<feature optional="YES">
				<name>Path of the Totem Warrior: Spirit Seeker</name>
				<text>Yours is a path that seeks attunement with the natural world, giving you a kinship with beasts. At 3rd level when you adopt this path, you gain the ability to cast the beast sense and speak with animals spells, but only as rituals, as described in chapter 10.</text>
			</feature>
			<feature optional="YES">
				<name>Path of the Totem Warrior: Totem Spirit</name>
				<text>At 3rd level, when you adopt this path, you choose a totem spirit and gain its feature. You must make or acquire a physical totem object- an amulet or similar adornment — that incorporates fur or feathers, claws, teeth, or bones of the totem animal. At your option, you also gain minor physical attributes that are reminiscent of your totem spirit. For example, if you have a bear totem spirit, you might be unusually hairy and thick-skinned, or if your totem is the eagle, your eyes turn bright yellow.</text>
				<text>Your totem animal might be an animal related to those listed here but more appropriate to your homeland. For example, you could choose a hawk or vulture in place of an eagle.</text>
			</feature>
			<feature optional="YES">
				<name>Totem Spirit (Bear)</name>
				<text>While raging, you have resistance to all damage except psychic damage. The spirit of the bear makes you tough enough to stand up to any punishment.</text>
			</feature>
			<feature optional="YES">
				<name>Totem Spirit (Eagle)</name>
				<text>While you're raging and aren't wearing heavy armor, other creatures have disadvantage on opportunity attack rolls against you, and you can use the Dash action as a bonus action on your turn. The spirit of the eagle makes you into a predator who can weave through the fray with ease.</text>
			</feature>
			<feature optional="YES">
				<name>Totem Spirit (Elk)</name>
				<text>While you're raging and aren't wearing heaving armor, your waliing speed increases by 15 feet. The spirit of the elk makes you extraordinarily swift.</text>
			</feature>
			<feature optional="YES">
				<name>Totem Spirit (Tiger)</name>
				<text>While raging, you can add 10 feet to your long jump distance and 3 feet to your high jump distance. The spirit of the tiger empowers your leaps.</text>
			</feature>
			<feature optional="YES">
				<name>Totem Spirit (Wolf)</name>

If the creature can see or hear you, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw (DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier) or be frightened of you until the end of your next turn.

				<text>    You learn an additional bard spell of your choice at each level except 12th, 16th, 19th, and 20th. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 3rd level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.</text>
				<text>    Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the bard spells you know and replace it with another spell from the bard spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</text>
				<text />
				<text>Spellcasting Ability</text>
				<text>Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your bard spells. Your magic comes from the heart and soul you pour into the performance of your music or oration. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a bard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</text>
				<text>    Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</text>
				<text>    Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</text>
				<text />
				<text>Ritual Casting</text>
				<text>You can cast any bard spell you know as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag.</text>
				<text />
				<text>Spellcasting Focus</text>
				<text>You can use a musical instrument (found in chapter 5) as a spellcasting focus for your bard spells.</text>

				<text>Beginning at 2nd level, you can use soothing music or oration to help revitalize your wounded allies during a short rest. If you or any friendly creatures who can hear your performance regain hit points by spending Hit Dice at the end of the short rest, each of those creatures regains an extra 1d6 hit points.</text>
				<text>    The extra hit points increase when you reach certain levels in this class: to 1d8 at 9th level, to 1d10 at 13th level, and to 1d12 at 17th level.</text>

				<name>Bard College</name>
				<text>At 3rd level, you delve into the advanced techniques of a bard college of your choice: the College of Lore or the College of Valor, both detailed at the end of the class description. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th and 14th level.</text>
			</feature>
			<feature optional ="YES">
				<name>Bard College: College of Lore</name>
				<text>Bards of the College of Lore know something about most things, collecting bits of knowledge from sources as diverse as scholarly tomes and peasant tales. Whether singing folk ballads in taverns or elaborate compositions in royal courts, these bards use their gifts to hold audiences spellbound. When the applause dies down, the audience members might find themselves questioning everything they held to be true, from their faith in the priesthood of the local temple to their loyalty to the king.</text>
				<text />
				<text>The loyalty of these bards lies in the pursuit of beauty and truth, not in fealty to a monarch or following the tenets of a deity. A noble who keeps such a bard as a herald or advisor knows that the bard would rather be honest than politic.</text>
				<text />
				<text>The college's members gather in libraries and sometimes in actual colleges, complete with classrooms and dormitories, to share their lore with one another. They also meet at festivals or affairs of state, where they can expose corruption, unravel lies, and poke fun at self-important figures of authority.</text>

				<name>Bard College: College of Valor</name>
				<text>Bards of the College of Lore know something about most things, collecting bits of knowledge from sources as diverse as scholarly tomes and peasant tales. Whether singing folk ballads in taverns or elaborate</text>
				<text />
				<text>Bards of the College of Valor are daring skalds whose tales keep alive the memory of the great heroes of the past, and thereby inspire a new generation of heroes. These bards gather in mead halls or around great bonfires to sing the deeds of the mighty, both past and present. They travel the land to witness great events firsthand and to ensure that the memory of those events doesn't pass from the world. With their songs, they inspire others to reach the same heights of accomplishment as the heroes of old.</text>
			</feature>
			<feature optional="YES">
				<name>Bard College: College of Swords</name>
				<text>Bards of the College of Swords are called blades, and they entertain through daring feats of weapon prowess. Blades perform stunts such as sword swallowing, knife throwing and juggling, and mock combats. But though they use their weapons to entertain, they are also highly trained and skilled warriors in their own right.</text>
				<text>Their talent with weapons inspires many blades to lead double lives. One blade might use a circus troupe as cover for nefarious deeds such as assassination, robbery, and blackmail. Other blades strike at the wicked, bringing justice to bear against the cruel and powerful. Most troupes are happy to accept a blade’s talent for the excitement it adds to a performance, but few entertainers fully trust them.</text>
				<text>Blades who abandon lives as entertainers have often run into trouble that makes maintaining their secret activities impossible. A blade caught stealing or engaging in vigilante justice is too great a liability for most performer troupes. With their weapon skills as their greatest asset, these blades either take up work as enforcers for thieves’ guilds or strike out on their own as adventurers.</text>
			</feature>
			<feature optional="YES">
				<name>Bard College: College of Satire</name>
				<text>Bards of the College of Satire are called jesters. They use lowbrow stories, daring acrobatics, and cutting jokes to entertain audiences, ranging from the crowds in a rundown dockside pub to the nobles of a king’s royal court. Where other bards seek forgotten lore or tales of epic bravery, jesters ferret out embarrassing and hilarious stories of all kinds. Whether telling the ribald tale of a brawny stable hand’s affair with an aged duchess or a mocking satire of a paladin of Helm’s cloying innocence, a jester never lets taste, social decorum, or shame get in the way of a good laugh.</text>
				<text>While jesters are masters of puns, jokes, and verbal barbs, they are much more than just comic relief. They are expected to mock and provoke, taking advantage of how even the most powerful folk are expected by tradition to endure a jester’s barbs with good humor. This expectation allows a jester to serve as a critic or a voice of reason when others are too intimidated to speak the truth.</text>
				<text>For the duchess with a taste for strapping young laborers, such tales might serve to warn the targets of her affections and force her to change her ways for lack of willing partners. Striking back at the jester only ruins her already damaged reputation, and might provide the best evidencethat the jester’s satires have hit their mark. But if she is kind and generous to her conquests, the jokes and stories cast her as a kind of folk hero, while drawing even more potential partners to her.</text>
				<text>Jesters are loyal to only one cause: the pursuit and propagation of the truth. They use their comedy and innocuous appearance to break down social barriers and expose corruption, incompetence, and stupidity among the rich and powerful. Whether revealing a con artist’s treachery or exposing a baron’s plans for war as driven by greed and bloodlust, a jester serves as the conscience of a realm.</text>
				<text>Jesters adventure to safeguard the common folk and to undermine the plans of the rich, powerful, and arrogant. Their magic bolsters allies’ spirits while casting doubt into foes’ minds. Among bards, jesters are unmatched acrobats, and their ability to tumble, dodge, leap, and climb makes them slippery opponents in battle.</text>

			<feature>
				<name>Expertise</name>
				<text>At 3rd level, choose two of your skill proficiencies. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses either of the chosen proficiencies.</text>
				<text>    At 10th level, you can choose another two skill proficiencies to gain this benefit.</text>
			</feature>
			<feature optional="YES">
				<name>College of Lore: Bonus Proficiencies</name>
				<text>When you join the College of Lore at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with three skills of your choice.</text>
			</feature>
			<feature optional="YES">
				<name>College of Lore: Cutting Words</name>
				<text>Also at 3rd level, you learn how to use your wit to distract, confuse, and otherwise sap the confidence and competence of others. When a creature that you can see within 60 feet of you makes an attack roll, an ability check, or a damage roll, you can use your reaction to expend one of your uses of Bardic Inspiration, rolling a Bardic Inspiration die and subtracting the number rolled from the creature's roll. You can choose to use this feature after the creature makes its roll, but before the DM determines whether the attack roll or ability check succeeds or fails, or before the creature deals its damage. The creature is immune if it can't hear you or if it's immune to being charmed.</text>
			</feature>
			<feature optional="YES">
				<name>College of Satire: Bonus Proficiencies</name>
				<text>When you join the College of Satire at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with thieves' tools. You also gain proficiency in Sleight of Hand and one additional skill of your choice. If you are already proficient with thieves' tools or in Sleight of Hand, choose another skill proficiency for each proficiency you already have.</text>
			</feature>
			<feature optional="YES">
				<name>College of Satire: Tumbling Fool</name>
				<text>At 3rd level, you master a variety of acrobatic techniques that allow you to evade danger. As a bonus action, you can tumble. When you tumble, you gain the following benefits for the rest of your turn:</text>
				<text />
				<text>• You gain the benefits of taking the Dash and Disengage actions.</text>
				<text />
				<text>• You gain a climbing speed equal to your current speed.</text>
				<text />
				<text>• You take half damage from falling.</text>
			</feature>
			<feature optional="YES">

				<text>When you join the College of Blades at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with medium armor and with scimitars.</text>

			<feature optional="YES">
				<name>College of Swords: Fighting Style</name>
				<text>The College of Blades emphasizes mastery with weapons, granting you access to the two-weapon fighting option for the Fighting Style class feature, which is as follows.</text>
				<text>When you engage in two-weapon fighting, you can add your ability modifier to the damage of the second attack.</text>
			</feature>
			<feature optional="YES">
				<name>College of Swords: Blade Flourish</name>
				<text>At 3rd level, you learn to conduct impressive displays of skill with your weapons. When you use the Attack action on your turn and attack with a dagger, longsword, rapier, scimitar, or shortsword, you can attempt one of the following flourishes.</text>
				<text />
				<text>	Defensive Flourish:</text>
				<text>You spin your weapon around you in swift circles, creating a hypnotic display. As a bonus action, you expend one use of Bardic Inspiration, rolling a Bardic Inspiration die and applying the number rolled as a bonus to your AC until the start of your next turn.</text>
				<text />
				<text>	Trick Shooter's Flourish:</text>
				<text>This favorite trick of knife throwers allows you to expend one use of Bardic Inspiration as a bonus action. Roll a Bardic Inspiration die and apply the number rolled as a bonus to the next ranged attack roll you make with a dagger this turn. If the target of the attack is an unattended, inanimate object, the bonus equals double the die roll.</text>
				<text />
				<text>	Unnerving Flourish:</text>
				<text>Your deadly display of combat prowess unnerves your opponents, leaving them cowering in fear and at your mercy. Whenever you reduce a creature to 0 hit points with a melee attack, you can use a bonus action to expend one use of Bardic Inspiration, and instead leave the creature at 1 hit point.</text>
				<text>The creature is frightened of you for a number of minutes equal to your Charisma modifier. It must also make a Charisma saving throw with a DC equal to your spellcasting DC + a bonus equal to the roll of your Bardic Inspiration die. If the creature fails this saving throw, it answers truthfully any questions you ask it and obeys your direct orders while it is frightened by this effect.</text>
			</feature>
			<feature optional="YES">
				<name>College of Valor: Bonus Proficiencies</name>
				<text>When you join the College of Valor at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with medium armor, shields, and martial weapons.</text>
			</feature>
			<feature optional="YES">
				<name>College of Valor: Combat Inspiration</name>
				<text>Also at 3rd level, you learn to inspire others in battle. A creature that has a Bardic Inspiration die from you can roll that die and add the number rolled to a weapon damage roll it just made. Alternatively, when an attack roll is made against the creature, it can use its reaction to roll the Bardic Inspiration die and add the number rolled to its AC against that attack, after seeing the roll but before knowing whether it hits or misses.</text>

				<name>Countercharm</name>
				<text>At 6th level, you gain the ability to use musical notes or words of power to disrupt mind-influencing effects. As an action, you can start a performance that lasts until the end of your next turn. During that time, you and any friendly creatures within 30 feet of you have advantage on saving throws against being frightened or charmed. A creature must be able to hear you to gain this benefit. The performance ends early if you are incapacitated or silenced or if you voluntarily end it (no action required).</text>
			</feature>
			<feature optional="YES">
				<name>College of Satire: Fool's Insight</name>
				<text>At 6th level, your ability to gather stories and lore gains a supernatural edge. You can cast detect thoughts up to a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier. You regain any expended uses of this ability after completing a long rest.</text>
				<text>	If a creature resists your attempt to probe deeper and succeeds at its saving throw against your detect thoughts, it immediately suffers an embarrassing social gaffe. It might loudly pass gas, unleash a thunderous burp, trip and fall, or be compelled to tell a tasteless joke.</text>
			</feature>
			<feature optional="YES">

Roll a Bardic Inspiration die and add the number rolled to your attack, saving throw, or ability check, using the new result in place of the failed one.</text>
				<text>	If using this ability grants you a success on the attack, saving throw, or ability check, note the number you rolled on the Bardic Inspiration die.

				<name>Spellcasting</name>
				<text>As a conduit for divine power, you can cast cleric spells. See chapter 10 for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 11 for a selection of cleric spells.</text>
				<text />
				<text>Cantrips</text>
				<text>At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the cleric spell list. You learn additional cleric cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Cleric table.</text>
				<text />
				<text>Preparing and Casting Spells</text>
				<text>The Cleric table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</text>
				<text>    You prepare the list of cleric spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the cleric spell list. When you do so, choose a number of cleric spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your cleric level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</text>
				<text>    For example, if you are a 3rd-level cleric, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell cure wounds, you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells.</text>
				<text>    You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of cleric spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</text>
				<text />
				<text>Spellcasting Ability</text>
				<text>Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your cleric spells. The power of your spells comes from your devotion to your deity. You use your Wisdom whenever a cleric spell refers to your spellcasting ability.

			<feature>
				<name>Divine Domain</name>
				<text>Choose one domain related to your deity: Arcana, Knowledge, Life, Light, Nature, Tempest, Trickery, or War. Each domain is detailed in their own feature, and each one provides examples of gods associated with it. Your choice grants you domain spells and other features when you choose it at 1st level. It also grants you additional ways to use Channel Divinity when you gain that feature at 2nd level, and additional benefits at 6th, 8th, and 17th levels.</text>
				<text />
				<text>Domain Spells</text>
				<text>Each domain has a list of spells-its domain spells-that you gain at the cleric levels noted in the domain description. Once you gain a domain spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day.</text>
				<text>    If you have a domain spell that doesn't appear on the cleric spell list, the spell is nonetheless a cleric spell for you.</text>
			</feature>
			<feature optional="YES">
				<name>Divine Domain Arcana</name>
				<text>Magic is an energy that suffuses the multiverse and that fuels both destruction and creation. Gods of the Arcana domain know the secrets and potential of magic intimately. For some of these gods, magical knowledge is a great responsibility that comes with a special understanding of the nature of reality. Other gods of Arcana see magic as pure power, to be used as its wielder sees fit.</text>
				<text />
				<text>The gods of this domain are often associated with knowledge, as learning and arcane power tend to go hand-in-hand. In the Realms, deities of this domain include Azuth and Mystra, as well as Corellon Larethian of the elven pantheon. In other worlds, this domain includes Hecate, Math Mathonwy, and Isis; the triple moon gods of Solinari, Lunitari, and Nuitari of Krynn; and Boccob, Vecna, and WeeJas of Greyhawk.</text>

				<name>Divine Domain: Death</name>
				<text>The Death domain is concerned with the forces that cause death, as well as the negative energy that gives rise to undead creatures. Deities such as Chemosh, Myrkul, and WeeJas are patrons of necromancers, death knights, liches, mummy lords, and vampires. Gods of the Death domain also embody murder (Anubis, Bhaal, and Pyremius), pain (Iuz or Loviatar), disease or poison (Incabulos, Talona, or Morgion), and the underworld (Hades and He!).</text>

Some teach that knowledge is to be gathered and shared in libraries and universities, or promote the practical knowledge of craft and invention. Some deities hoard knowledge and keep its secrets to themselves. And some promise their followers that they will gain tremendous power if they unlock the secrets of the multiverse. Followers of these gods study esoteric lore, collect old tomes, delve into the secret places of the earth, and learn all they can. Some gods of knowledge promote the practical knowledge of craft and invention, including smith deities like Gond, Reorx, Onatar, Moradin, Hephaestus, and Goibhniu.</text>

				<text>The Life domain focuses on the vibrant positive energy - one of the fundamental forces of the universe -  that sustains all life. The gods of life promote vitality and health through healing the sick and wounded, caring for those in need, and driving away the forces of death and undeath. Almost any non-evil deity can claim influence over this domain, particularly agricultural deities (such as Chauntea, Arawai, and Demeter), sun gods (such as Lathander, Pelor, and Re-Horakhty), gods of healing or endurance (such as Ilmater, Mishakal, Apollo, and Diancecht), and gods of home and community (such as Hestia, Hathor, and Boldrei).</text>

Some of these gods are portrayed as the sun itself or as a charioteer who guides the sun across the sky. Others are tireless sentinels whose eyes pierce every shadow and see through every deception. Some are deities of beauty and artistry, who teach that art is a vehicle for the soul's improvement. Clerics of a god of light are enlightened souls infused with radiance and the power of their gods' discerning vision, charged with chasing away lies and burning away darkness.</text>

				<name>Divine Domain: Nature</name>
				<text>Gods of nature are as varied as the natural world itself, from inscrutable gods of the deep forests (such as Silvanus, Obad-Hai, Chislev, Balinor, and Pan) to friendly deities associated with particular springs and groves (such as Eldath). Druids revere nature as a whole and might serve one of these deities, practicing mysterious rites and reciting all-but-forgotten prayers in their own secret tongue. But many of these gods have clerics as well, champions who take a more active role in advancing the interests of a particular nature god. These clerics might hunt the evil monstrosities that despoil the woodlands, bless the harvest of the faithful, or wither the crops of those who anger their gods.</text>

They include gods of lightning and thunder, gods of earthquakes, some fire gods, and certain gods of violence, physical strength, and courage. In some pantheons, a god of this domain rules over other deities and is known for swift justice delivered by thunderbolts. In the pantheons of seafaring people, gods of this domain are ocean deities and the patrons of sailors. Tempest gods send their clerics to inspire fear in the common folk, either to keep those folk on the path of righteousness or to encourage them to offer sacrifices of propitiation to ward off divine wrath.</text>

				<name>Divine Domain: Trickery</name>
				<text>Gods of trickery - such as Tymora, Beshaba, Olidammara, the Traveler, Garl Glittergold, and Loki - are mischief-makers and instigators who stand as a constant challenge to the accepted order among both gods and mortals. They're patrons of thieves, scoundrels, gamblers, rebels, and liberators. Their clerics are a disruptive force in the world, puncturing pride, mocking tyrants, stealing from the rich, freeing captives, and flouting hollow traditions. They prefer subterfuge, pranks, deception, and theft rather than direct confrontation.</text>

				<name>Divine Domain: War</name>
				<text>War has many manifestations. It can make heroes of ordinary people. It can be desperate and horrific, with acts of cruelty and cowardice eclipsing instances of excellence and courage. In either case, the gods of war watch over warriors and reward them for their great deeds. The clerics of such gods excel in battle, inspiring others to fight the good fight or offering acts of violence as prayers. Gods of war include champions of honor and chivalry (such as Torm, Heironeous, and Kiri-Jolith) as well as gods of destruction and pillage (such as Erythnul, the Fury, Gruumsh, and Ares) and gods of conquest and domination (such as Bane, Hextor, and Maglubiyet). Other war gods (such as Tempus, Nike, and Nuada) take a more neutral stance, promoting war in all its manifestations and supporting warriors in any circumstance.</text>

				<name>Druidic</name>
				<text>You know Druidic, the secret language of druids. You can speak the language and use it to leave hidden messages. You and others who know this language automatically spot such a message. Others spot the message's presence with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check but can't decipher it without magic.</text>
			</feature>
			<feature>
				<name>Spellcasting</name>
				<text>Drawing on the divine essence of nature itself, you can cast spells to shape that essence to your will. See chapter 10 for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 11 for the druid spell list.</text>
				<text />
				<text>Cantrips</text>
				<text>At 1st level, you know two cantrips of your choice from the druid spell list. You learn additional druid cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Druid table.</text>
				<text />
				<text>Preparing and Casting Spells</text>
				<text>The Druid table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these druid spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</text>
				<text>    You prepare the list of druid spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the druid spell list. When you do so, choose a number of druid spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your druid level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</text>
				<text>    For example, if you are a 3rd-level druid, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell cure wounds, you can cast it using a 1st-level ar 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells.</text>
				<text>    You can also change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of druid spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</text>
				<text />
				<text>Spellcasting Ability</text>
				<text>Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your druid spells, since your magic draws upon your devotion and attunement to nature. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a druid spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</text>
				<text>    Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</text>
				<text>    Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</text>
				<text />
				<text>Ritual Casting</text>
				<text>You can cast a druid spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.</text>
				<text />
				<text>Spellcasting Focus</text>
				<text>You can use a druidic focus (found in chapter 5) as a spellcasting focus for your druid spells</text>
			</feature>
		</autolevel>

		<autolevel level="2">
			<feature>
				<name>Wild Shape</name>
				<text>Starting at 2nd level, you can use your action to magically assume the shape of a beast that you have seen before. You can use this feature twice. You regain expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.</text>
				<text>    Your druid level determines the beasts you can transform into, as shown in the Beast Shapes table. At 2nd level, for example, you can transform into any beast that has a challenge rating of 1/4 or lower that doesn't have a flying or swimming speed.</text>
				<text />
				<text>Beast Shapes</text>
				<text>Level    Max. CR    Limitations    Example</text>
				<text>2nd    1/4 No flying or swimming speed    Wolf</text>
				<text>4th    1/2 No flying speed    Crocodile</text>
				<text>8th    1    —    Giant eagle</text>
				<text />
				<text>    You can stay in a beast shape for a number of hours equal to half your druid level (rounded down). You then revert to your normal form unless you expend another use of this feature. You can revert to your normal form earlier by using a bonus action on your turn. You automatically revert if you fall unconscious, drop to 0 hit points, or die.</text>
				<text>    While you are transformed, the following rules apply:</text>
				<text>• Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the beast, but you retain your alignment, personality, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature. If the creature has the same proficiency as you and the bonus in its stat block is higher than yours, use the creature's bonus instead of yours. If the creature has any legendary or lair actions, you can't use them.</text>
				<text>• When you transform, you assume the beast's hit points and Hit Dice. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. However, if you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form. For example, if you take 10 damage in animal form and have only 1 hit point left, you revert and take 9 damage. As long as the excess damage doesn't reduce your normal form to 0 hit points, you aren't knocked unconscious.</text>
				<text>• You can't cast spells, and your ability to speak or take any action that requires hands is limited to the capabilities of your beast form. Transforming doesn't break your concentration on a spell you've already cast, however, or prevent you from taking actions that are part of a spell, such as call lightning, that you've already cast.</text>
				<text>• You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them if the new form is physically capable of doing so. However, you can't use any of your special senses, such as darkvision, unless your new form also has that sense.</text>
				<text>• You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the DM decides whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature's shape and size. Your equipment doesn't change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can't wear must either fall to the ground or merge with it. Equipment that merges with the form has no effect until you leave the form.</text>
			</feature>
			<feature>
				<name>Druid Circle</name>
				<text>At 2nd level, you choose to identify with a circle of druids: the Circle of the Land or the Circle of the Moon, both detailed at the end of the class description. Your choice grants you features at 2nd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level.</text>
			</feature>
			<feature optional="YES">
				<name>Druid Circle: Circle of the Land</name>
				<text>The Circle of the Land is made up of mystics and sages who safeguard ancient knowledge and rites through a vast oral tradition. These druids meet within sacred circles of trees or standing stones to whisper primal secrets in Druidic. The circle's wisest members preside as the chief priests of communities that hold to the Old Faith and serve as advisors to the rulers of those folk. As a member of this circle, your magic is influenced by the land where you were initiated into the circle's mysterious rites.</text>
			</feature>
			<feature optional="YES">
				<name>Druid Circle: Circle of the Moon</name>
				<text>Druids of the Circle of the Moon are fierce guardians of the wilds. Their order gathers under the full moon to share news and trade warnings. They haunt the deepest parts of the wilderness, where they might go for weeks on end before crossing paths with another humanoid creature, let alone another druid.</text>
				<text />
				<text>Changeable as the moon, a druid of this circle might prowl as a great cat one night, soar over the treetops as an eagle the next day, and crash through the undergrowth in bear form to drive off a trespassing monster. The wild is in the druid's blood.</text>
			</feature>
			<feature optional="YES">
				<name>Circle of Land: Bonus Cantrip</name>
				<text>You learn one additional druid cantrip of your choice.</text>
			</feature>
			<feature optional="YES">
				<name>Circle of Land: Natural Recovery</name>
				<text>Starling at 2nd level, you can regain some of your magical energy by sitting in meditation and communing with nature. During a short rest, you choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level that is equal to or less than half your druid level (rounded up), and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher. You can't use this feature again until you finish a long rest</text>
				<text>    For example, when you are a 4th-level druid, you can recover up to two levels worth of spell slots. You can recover either a 2nd-level slot or two 1st-level slots.</text>
			</feature>
			<feature optional="YES">
				<name>Circle of Land: Circle Spells</name>
				<text>Your mystical connection to the land infuses you with the ability to cast certain spells. At 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th level you gain access to circle spells connected to the land where you became a druid. Choose that land - arctic, coast, desert, forest, grassland, mountain, swamp, or Underdark - and consult the associated list of spells.</text>
				<text />
				<text>Once you gain access to a circle spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you gain access to a spell that doesn't appear on the druid spell list, the spell is nonetheless a druid spell for you.</text>
			</feature>
			<feature optional="YES">
				<name>Circle of Moon: Combat Wild Shape</name>
				<text>You gain the ability to use Wild Shape on your turn as a bonus action, rather than as an action.</text>

			</feature>
			<feature optional="YES">
				<name>Circle of Moon: Circle Forms</name>
				<text>The rites of your circle grant you the ability to transform into more dangerous animal forms. Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Wild Shape to transform into a beast with a challenge rating as high as 1 (you ignore the Max.

				<name>Martial Archetype</name>
				<text>At 3rd level, you choose an archetype that you strive to emulate in your combat styles and techniques. Choose Champion, Battle Master, or Eldritch Knight, all detailed at the end of the class description. The archetype you choose grants you features at 3rd level and again at 7th, 10th, 15th, and 18th level.</text>
			</feature>
			<feature optional="YES">
				<name>Martial Archetype: Champion</name>
				<text>The archetypal Champion focuses on the development of raw physical power honed to deadly perfection. Those who model themselves on this archetype combine rigorous training with physical excellence to deal devastating blows.</text>
			</feature>
			<feature optional="YES">
				<name>Martial Archetype: Battle Master</name>
				<text>Those who emulate the archetypal Battle Master employ martial techniques passed down through generations. To a Battle Master, combat is an academic field, sometimes including subjects beyond battle such as weaponsmithing and calligraphy. Not every fighter absorbs the lessons of history, theory, and artistry that are reflected in the Battle Master archetype, but those who do are well-rounded fighters of great skill and knowledge.</text>
			</feature>
			<feature optional="YES">
				<name>Martial Archetype: Cavalier</name>
				<text>The archetypal Cavalier excels at mounted combat. Usually born to nobility and raised in a royal court, a Cavalier is equally at home leading a cavalry charge or exchanging witty repartee at a state dinner.</text>
			</feature>
			<feature optional="YES">
				<name>Martial Archetype: Eldritch Knight</name>
				<text>The archetypal Eldritch Knight combines the martial mastery common to all fighters with a careful study of magic. Eldritch Knights use magical techniques similar to those practiced by wizards. They focus their study on two of the eight schools of magic - abjuration and evocation. Abjuration spells grant an Eldritch Knight additional protection in battle, and evocation spells deal damage to many foes at once, extending the fighter's reach in combat. These knights learn a comparatively small number of spells, committing them to memory instead of keeping them in a spellbook.</text>
			</feature>
			<feature optional="YES">
				<name>Martial Archetype: Purple Dragon Knight (Banneret)</name>
				<text>Purple Dragon Knights are warriors who hail from the kingdom of Cormyr. Pledged to protect the crown, they take the fight against evil beyond the kingdom's borders. They are tasked with wandering the land as knights errant, relying on their judgment, bravery, and fidelity to guide them in defeating evildoers.</text>
				<text>    A Purple Dragon Knight inspires greatness in others by committing brave deeds in battle. The mere presence of a knight in a hamlet is enough to cause some orcs and bandits to seek easier prey. A lone knight is a skilled warrior, but a knight leading a band of allies can transform even the most poorly equipped militia into a ferocious war band.</text>
				<text>    A knight prefers to lead through deeds, not words. As a knight spearheads an attack, the knight's actions can awaken reserves of courage and conviction in allies that they never suspected they had.</text>
			</feature>
			<feature optional="YES">
				<name>Purple Dragon Knight: Restriction: Knighthood</name>
				<text>Purple Dragon Knights are tied to a specific order of Cormyrean knighthood.</text>
				<text>    Banneret serves as the generic name for this archetype if you use it in other campaign settings or to model warlords other than the Purple Dragon Knights.</text>
			</feature>
			<feature optional="YES">
				<name>Purple Dragon Knight: Rallying Cry</name>
				<text>When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you learn how to inspire your allies to fight on past their injuries.</text>
				<text>    When you use your Second Wind feature, you can choose up to three creatures within 60 feet of you that are allied with you. Each one regains hit points equal to your fighter level, provided that the creature can see or hear you.</text>
			</feature>
			<feature optional="YES">
				<name>Martial Archetype: Scout</name>
				<text>The archetypal Scout excels at finding safe passage through dangerous regions. Scouts usually favor light armor and ranged weapons, but they are comfortable using heavier gear when faced with intense fighting.</text>
			</feature>
			<feature optional="YES">
				<name>Battle Master: Combat Superiority</name>
				<text>When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you learn maneuvers that are fueled by special dice called superiority dice.</text>
				<text />
				<text>Maneuvers</text>
				<text>You learn three maneuvers of your choice, which are listed in the Fighter (Battle Master) spell list, as well as optional features. Many maneuvers enhance an attack in some way. You can use only one maneuver per attack.</text>
				<text>    You learn two additional maneuvers of your choice at 7th, 10th, and 15th level. Each time you learn new maneuvers, you can also replace one maneuver you know with a different one.</text>
				<text />
				<text>Superiority Dice</text>
				<text>You have four superiority dice, which are d8s. A superiority die is expended when you use it. You regain all of your expended superiority dice when you finish a short or long rest.</text>
				<text>    You gain another superiority die at 7th level and one more at 15th level.</text>
				<text />
				<text>Saving Throws</text>
				<text>Some of your maneuvers require your target to make a saving throw to resist the maneuver's effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows: Maneuver save DC = 8 + proficiency bonus + your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice)</text>
			</feature>
			<feature optional="YES">
				<name>Battle Master: Student of War</name>
				<text>At 3rd level, you gain proficiency with one type of artisan's tools of your choice.</text>

			<feature optional="YES">
				<name>Cavalier: Bonus Proficiencies</name>
				<text>When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain proficiency in two of the following skills of your choice: Animal Handling, Insight, Performance, or Persuasion. You can choose to gain one tool proficiency in place of one skill proficiency.</text>
			</feature>
			<feature optional="YES">
				<name>Cavalier: Born to the Saddle</name>
				<text>At 3rd level, you have advantage on saving throws made to avoid falling off your mount. If you fall off your mount, you always land on your feet if you are capable of taking actions. Mounting or dismounting a creature costs you only 5 feet of movement, rather than half your speed.</text>
			</feature>
			<feature optional="YES">
				<name>Cavalier: Combat Superiority</name>

				<text />
				<text>• When you make an attack with a lance while mounted, you can expend one superiority die to add it to your damage roll. In addition, the target of the attack must make a Strength saving throw (DC 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier) or be knocked prone.:</text>
				<text />
				<text>• If either you or your mount is hit by an attack while you are mounted, you can expend one superiority die as a reaction, adding the number rolled to your or your mount&#8217;s AC. If the attack still hits, you or your mount take half damage from it.</text>
			</feature>
			<feature optional="YES">
				<name>Eldritch Knight: Spellcasting</name>
				<text>When you reach 3rd level, you augment your martial prowess with the ability to cast spells. See chapter 10 for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 11 for the wizard spell list.</text>
				<text />
				<text>Cantrips</text>
				<text>You learn two cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list. You learn an additional wizard cantrip of your choice at 10th level.</text>
				<text />
				<text>Spell Slots</text>
				<text>The Eldritch Knight Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</text>
				<text>For example, if you know the 1st-level spell shield and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast shield using either slot.</text>
				<text />
				<text>Spells Known of 1st-Level and Higher</text>
				<text>You know three 1st-level wizard spells of your choice, two of which you must choose from the abjuration and evocation spells on the wizard spell list.</text>
				<text>    The Spells Known column of the Eldritch Knight Spellcasting table shows when you learn more wizard spells of 1st level or higher. Each of these spells must be an abjuration or evocation spell of your choice, and must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 7th level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.</text>
				<text>    The spells you learn at 8th, 14th, and 20th level can come from any school of magic.</text>
				<text>    Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the wizard spells you know with another spell of your choice from the wizard spell list. The new spell must be of a level for which you have spell slots, and it must be an abjuration or evocation spell, unless you're replacing the spell you gained at 8th, 14th, or 20th level.</text>
				<text />
				<text>Spellcasting Ability</text>
				<text>Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your wizard spells, since you learn your spells through study and memorization. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a wizard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</text>
				<text>    Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</text>

The weapon must be within your reach throughout the ritual, at the conclusion of which you touch the weapon and forge the bond.</text>
				<text>    Once you have bonded a weapon to yourself, you can't be disarmed of that weapon unless you are incapacitated. If it is on the same plane of existence, you can summon that weapon as a bonus action on your turn, causing it to teleport instantly to your hand.</text>

				<text>Monks of the Way of Shadow follow a tradition that values stealth and subterfuge. These monks might be called ninjas or shadowdancers, and they serve as spies and assassins. Sometimes the members of a ninja monastery are family members, forming a clan sworn to secrecy about their arts and missions. Other monasteries are more like thieves' guilds, hiring out their services to nobles, rich merchants, or anyone else who can pay their fees. Regardless of their methods, the heads of these monasteries expect the unquestioning obedience of their students.</text>
			</feature>
			<feature optional="YES">
				<name>Monastic Tradition: Way of the Open Hand</name>
				<text>Monks of the Way of the Open Hand are the ultimate masters of martial arts combat, whether armed or unarmed. They learn techniques to push and trip their opponents, manipulate ki to heal damage to their bodies, and practice advanced meditation that can protect them from harm.</text>
			</feature>
			<feature optional="YES">
				<name>Monastic Tradition: Way of the Four Elements</name>
				<text>You follow a monastic tradition that teaches you to harness the elements. When you focus your ki, you can align yourself with the forces of creation and bend the four elements to your will, using them as an extension of your body. Some members of this tradition dedicate themselves to a single element, but others weave the elements together.</text>
				<text />
				<text>Many monks of this tradition tattoo their bodies with representations of their ki powers, commonly imagined as coiling dragons, but also as phoenixes, fish, plants, mountains, and cresting waves.</text>
			</feature>
			<feature optional="YES">
				<name>Way of Shadow: Shadow Arts</name>
				<text>You can use your ki to duplicate the effects of certain spells. As an action, you can spend 2 ki points to cast darkness, darkvision, pass without trace, or silence, without providing material components. Additionally, you gain the minor illusion cantrip if you don't already know it.</text>
			</feature>
			<feature optional="YES">
				<name>Way of the Open Hand: Open Hand Technique</name>
				<text>You can manipulate your enemy's ki when you harness your own. Whenever you hit a creature with one of the attacks granted by your Flurry of Blows, you can impose one of the following effects on that target.</text>
				<text />
				<text>• It must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone.</text>
				<text />
				<text>• It must make a Strength saving throw. If it fails, you can push it up to 15 feet away from you.</text>
				<text />
				<text>• It can't take reactions until the end of your next turn.</text>
			</feature>
			<feature optional="YES">
				<name>Way of the Four Elements: Disciple of the Elements</name>
				<text>You learn magical disciplines that harness the power of the four elements. A discipline requires you to spend ki points each time you use it.</text>
				<text />
				<text>You know the Elemental Attunement discipline and one other elemental discipline of your choice. You learn one additional elemental discipline of your choice at 6th, 11th, and 17th level.</text>
				<text />
				<text>Whenever you learn a new elemental discipline, you can also replace one elemental discipline that you already know with a different discipline.</text>
				<text />
				<text>Casting Elemental Spells. Some elemental disciplines allow you to cast spells. To cast one of these spells, you use its casting time and other rules, but you don't need to provide material components for it.</text>
				<text />
				<text>Once you reach 5th level in this class, you can spend additional ki points to increase the level of an elemental discipline spell that you cast, provided that the spell has an enhanced effect at a higher level, as burning hands does. The spell's level increases by 1 for each additional ki point you spend. For example, if you are a 5th-level monk and use Sweeping Cinder Strike to cast burning hands, you can spend 3 ki points to cast it as a 2nd-level spell (the discipline's base cost of 2 ki points plus 1).</text>
				<text />
				<text>The maximum number of ki points you can spend to cast a spell in this way (including its base ki point cost and any additional ki points you spend to increase its level) is determined by your monk level. At 5th level, you may spend up to 3 ki points; this increases to 4 ki points at 9th level, 5 at 13th level, and 6 at 17th level.</text>
			</feature>
			<feature>
				<name>Deflect Missiles</name>
				<text>Starting at 3rd level, you can use your reaction to deflect or catch the missile when you are hit by a ranged weapon attack. When you do so, the damage you take from the attack is reduced by 1d 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your monk level.</text>
				<text>    If you reduce the damage to 0, you can catch the missile if it is small enough for you to hold in one hand and you have at least one hand free. If you catch a missile in this way, you can spend 1 ki point to make a ranged attack (range 20 feet/60 feet) with the weapon or piece of ammunition you just caught, as part of the same reaction. You make this attack with proficiency, regardless of your weapon proficiencies, and the missile counts as a monk weapon for the attack.</text>
			</feature>
			<feature optional="YES">
				<name>Monastic Tradition: Way of the Long Death</name>
				<text>Monks of the Way of the Long Death are obsessed with the meaning and mechanics of dying.

		<text>A nonmagical wall of solid stone springs into existence at a point you choose within range. The wall is 6 inches thick and is composed of ten 10-foot-by-10-foot panels. Each panel must be contiguous with at least one other panel. Alternatively, you can create 10-foot-by-20-foot panels that are only 3 inches thick.</text>
		<text />
		<text>If the wall cuts through a creature's space when it appears, the creature is pushed to one side of the wall (your choice). If a creature would be surrounded on all sides by the wall (or the wall and another solid surface), that creature can make a Dexterity saving throw. On a success, it can use its reaction to move up to its speed so that it is no longer enclosed by the wall.</text>
		<text />
		<text>The wall can have any shape you desire, though it can't occupy the same space as a creature or object. the wall doesn't need to be vertical or resting on any firm foundation. It must, however, merge with and be solidly supported by existing stone. Thus you can use this spell to bridge a chasm or create a ramp.</text>
		<text />
		<text>If you create a span greater than 20 feet in length, you must halve the size of each panel to create supports. You can crudely shape the wall to create crenellations, battlements, and so on.</text>
		<text />
		<text>The wall is an object made of stone that can be damaged and thus breached. Each panel has AC 15 and 30 hit points per inch of thickness. Reducing a panel to 0 hit points destroys it and might cause connected panels to collapse at the DM's discretion.</text>

				<name>Divine Sense</name>
				<text>The presence of strong evil registers on your senses like a noxious odor, and powerful good rings like heavenly music in your ears. As an action, you can open your awareness to detect such forces. Until the end of your next turn, you know the location of any celestial, fiend, or undead within 60 feet of you that is not behind total cover. You know the type (celestial, fiend, or undead) of any being whose presence you sense, but not its identity (the vampire Count Strahd von Zarovich, for instance). Within the same radius, you also detect the presence of any place or object that has been consecrated or desecrated, as with the hallow spell.</text>
				<text>    You can use this feature a number of times equal to 1 + your Charisma modifier. When you finish a long rest, you regain all expended uses.</text>

				<name>Lay on Hands</name>
				<text>Your blessed touch can heal wounds. You have a pool of healing power that replenishes when you take a long rest. With that pool, you can restore a total number of hit points equal to your paladin level x 5.</text>
				<text>    As an action, you can touch a creature and draw power from the pool to restore a number of hit points to that creature, up to the maximum amount remaining in your pool.</text>
				<text>    Alternatively, you can expend 5 hit points from your pool of healing to cure the target of one disease or neutralize one poison affecting it. You can cure multiple diseases and neutralize multiple poisons with a single use of Lay on Hands, expending hit points separately for each one.</text>

			<feature optional="YES">
				<name>Fighting Style: Protection</name>

			</feature>
			<feature optional="YES">
				<name>Fighting Style: Tunnel Fighter</name>
				<text>As a bonus action, you can enter a defensive stance that lasts until the start of your next turn.

			</feature>
			<feature>
				<name>Spellcasting</name>
				<text>By 2nd level, you have learned to draw on divine magic through meditation and prayer to cast spells as a cleric does. See chapter 10 for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 11 for the paladin spell list.</text>
				<text />
				<text>Preparing and Casting Spells</text>
				<text>The Paladin table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells. To cast one of your paladin spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</text>
				<text>    You prepare the list of paladin spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the paladin spell list. When you do so, choose a number of paladin spells equal to your Charisma modifier + half your paladin level, rounded down (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</text>
				<text>    For example, if you are a 5th-level paladin, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Charisma of 14, your list of prepared spells can include four spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell cure wounds, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells.</text>
				<text>    You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of paladin spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</text>
				<text />
				<text>Spellcasting Ability</text>
				<text>Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your paladin spells, since their power derives from the strength of your convictions. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a paladin spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</text>
				<text>    Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</text>
				<text>    Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</text>
				<text />
				<text>Spellcasting Focus</text>
				<text>You can use a holy symbol (found in chapter 5) as a spellcasting focus for your paladin spells.</text>

Now you choose the Oath of Devotion, the Oath of the Ancients, the Oath of the Crown, or the Oath of Vengeance, all detailed at the end of the c1ass description.</text>

				<name>Oath of the Ancients Channel Divinity: Nature's Wrath</name>
				<text>You can use your Channel Divinity to invoke primeval forces to ensnare a foe. As an action, you can cause spectral vines to spring up and reach for a creature within 10 feet of you that you can see. The creature must succeed on a Strength or Dexterity saving throw (its choice) or be restrained. While restrained by the vines, the creature repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a success, it frees itself and the vines vanish.</text>

On a failed save, the creature is turned for 1 minute or until it takes damage.</text>
				<text>    A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can't willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can't take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there's nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action.</text>

				<name>Sacred Oath: Oath of the Ancients</name>
				<text>The Oath of the Ancients is as old as the race of elves and the rituals of the druids. Sometimes called fey knights, green knights, or horned knights, paladins who swear this oath cast their lot with the side of the light in the cosmic struggle against darkness because they love the beautiful and life-giving things of the world, not necessarily because they believe in principles of honor, courage, and justice. They adorn their armor and clothing with images of growing things - leaves, antlers, or flowers - to reflect their commitment to preserving life and light in the world.</text>
				<text />
				<text>Tenets of the Ancients</text>
				<text />
				<text>The tenets of the Oath of the Ancients have been preserved for uncounted centuries. This oath emphasizes the principles of good above any concerns of law or chaos. Its four central principles are simple.</text>
				<text>    Kindle the Light. Through your acts of mercy, kindness, and forgiveness, kindle the light of hope in the world, beating back despair.</text>
				<text>    Shelter the Light. Where there is good, beauty, love, and laughter in the world, stand against the wickedness that would swallow it. Where life flourishes, stand against the forces that would render it barren.</text>
				<text>    Preserve Your Own Light. Delight in song and laughter, in beauty and art. If you allow the light to die in your own heart, you can't preserve it in the world.</text>
				<text>    Be the Light. Be a glorious beacon for all who live in despair. Let the light of your joy and courage shine forth in all your deeds.</text>

For 1 minute, you add your Charisma modifier to attack rolls made with that weapon (with a minimum bonus of +1). The weapon also emits bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light 20 feet beyond that. If the weapon is not already magical, it becomes magical for the duration.</text>
				<text>    You can end this effect on your turn as part of any other action. If you are no longer holding or carrying this weapon, or if you fall unconscious, this effect ends.</text>

				<text>    A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can't willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can't take reactions.

				<name>Sacred Oath: Oath of Devotion</name>
				<text>The Oath of Devotion binds a paladin to the loftiest ideals of justice, virtue, and order. Sometimes called cavaliers, white knights, or holy warriors, these paladins meet the ideal of the knight in shining armor, acting with honor in pursuit of justice and the greater good. They hold themselves to the highest standards of conduct, and some, for better or worse, hold the rest of the world to the same standards. Many who swear this oath are devoted to gods of law and good and use their gods' tenets as the measure of their devotion. They hold angels - the perfect servants of good - as their ideals, and incorporate images of angelic wings into their helmets or coats of arms.</text>
				<text />
				<text>Tenets of Devotion</text>
				<text />
				<text>Though the exact words and strictures of the Oath of Devotion vary, paladins of this oath share these tenets.</text>
				<text>    Honesty. Don't lie or cheat. Let your word be your promise.</text>
				<text>    Courage. Never fear to act, though caution is wise.</text>
				<text>    Compassion. Aid others, protect the weak, and punish those who threaten them. Show mercy to your foes, but temper it with wisdom.</text>
				<text>    Honor. Treat others with fairness, and let your honorable deeds be an example to them. Do as much good as possible while causing the least amount of harm.</text>
				<text>    Duty. Be responsible for your actions and their consequences, protect those entrusted to your care, and obey those who have just authority over you.</text>

				<name>Oath of Vengeance Channel Divinity: Abjure Enemy</name>
				<text>As an action, you present your holy symbol and speak a prayer of denunciation, using your Channel Divinity. Choose one creature within 60 feet of you that you can see. That creature must make a Wisdom saving throw, unless it is immune to being frightened. Fiends and undead have disadvantage on this saving throw.</text>
				<text>    On a failed save, the creature is frightened for 1 minute or until it takes any damage. While frightened, the creature's speed is 0, and it can't benefit from any bonus to its speed.</text>
				<text>    On a successful save, the creature's speed is halved for 1 minute or until the creature takes any damage.</text>
			</feature>
			<feature optional="YES">
				<name>Oath of Vengeance Channel Divinity: Vow of Enmity</name>

				<text />
				<text>17th - hold monster, scrying</text>
			</feature>
			<feature optional="YES">
				<name>Sacred Oath: Oath of Vengeance</name>
				<text>The Oath of Vengeance is a solemn commitment to punish those who have committed a grievous sin. When evil forces slaughter helpless villagers, when an entire people turns against the will of the gods, when a thieves' guild grows too violent and powerful, when a dragon rampages through the countryside - at times like these, paladins arise and swear an Oath of Vengeance to set right that which has gone wrong. To these paladins - sometimes called avengers or dark knights - their own purity is not as important as delivering justice.</text>
				<text />
				<text>Tenets of Vengeance: The tenets of the Oath of Vengeance vary by paladin, but all the tenets revolve around punishing wrongdoers by any means necessary. Paladins who uphold these tenets are willing to sacrifice even their own righteousness to mete out justice upon those who do evil, so the paladins are often neutral or lawful neutral in alignment. The core principles of the tenets are brutally simple.</text>
				<text>    Fight the Greater Evil. Faced with a choice of fighting my sworn foes or combating a lesser evil. I choose the greater evil.</text>
				<text>    No Mercy for the Wicked. Ordinary foes might win my mercy, but my sworn enemies do not.</text>
				<text>    By Any Means Necessary. My qualms can't get in the way of exterminating my foes.</text>
				<text>    Restitution. If my foes wreak ruin on the world, it is because I failed to stop them. I must help those harmed by their misdeeds.</text>

				<name>Oathbreaker Channel Divinity: Control Undead</name>
				<text>As an action, the paladin targets one undead creature he or she can see within 30 feet of him or her. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target must obey the paladin's commands for the next 24 hours, or until the paladin uses this Channel Divinity option again. An undead whose challenge rating is equal to or greater than the paladin's level is immune to this effect.</text>
			</feature>
			<feature optional="YES">
				<name>Oathbreaker Channel Divinity: Dreadful Aspect</name>
				<text>As an action, the paladin channels the darkest emotions and focuses them into a burst of magical menace. Each creature of the paladin's choice within 30 feet of the paladin must make a Wisdom saving throw if it can see the paladin. On a failed save, the target is frightened of the paladin for 1 minute. If a creature frightened by this effect ends its turn more than 30 feet away from the paladin, it can attempt another Wisdom saving throw to end the effect on it.</text>
			</feature>
			<feature optional="YES">
				<name>Sacred Oath: Oath of the Crown</name>
				<text>The Oath of the Crown is sworn to the ideals of civilization, be it the spirit of a nation, fealty to a sovereign, or service to a deity of law and rulership. The paladins who swear this oath dedicate themselves to serving society and, in particular, the laws that hold society together. These paladins are the watchful guardians on the walls, standing against the chaotic tides of barbarism that threaten to tear down all that civilization has built, and are commonly known as guardians, exemplars, or sentinels. Often, paladins who swear this oath are members of an order of knighthood in service to a nation or sovereign, and undergo their oath as part of their admission to the order's ranks.</text>
				<text/>
				<text>Tenets of the Crown:</text>
				<text>    The tenets of the Oath of the Crown are often set by the sovereign to which their oath is sworn, but generally emphasize the following tenets.</text>
				<text/>
				<text>Law: The law is paramount. It is the mortar that holds the stones of civilization together, and it must be respected.</text>
				<text/>
				<text>Loyalty: Your word is your bond. Without loyalty, oaths and laws are meaningless.</text>
				<text/>
				<text>Courage: You must be willing to do what needs to be done for the sake of order, even in the face of overwhelming odds. If you don't act, then who will?</text>

				<text>    You have advantage on Wisdom (Survival) checks to track your favored enemies, as well as on Intelligence checks to recall information about them.</text>
				<text>    When you gain this feature, you also learn one language of your choice that is spoken by your favored enemies, if they speak one at all.</text>

			<feature>
				<name>Spellcasting</name>
				<text>By the time you reach 2nd level, you have learned to use the magical essence of nature to cast spells, much as a druid does. See chapter 10 for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 11 for the ranger spell list. </text>
				<text />
				<text>Spell Slots</text>
				<text>The Ranger table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</text>
				<text>    For example, if you know the 1st-level spell animal friendship and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast animal friendship using either slot. </text>
				<text />
				<text>Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher</text>
				<text>You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the ranger spell list.</text>
				<text>    You learn an additional ranger spell of your choice at each odd numbered level thereafter. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 5th level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.</text>
				<text>    Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the ranger spells you know and replace it with another spell from the ranger spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots. </text>
				<text />
				<text>Spellcasting Ability</text>
				<text>Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your ranger spells, since your magic draws on your attunement to nature. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a ranger spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</text>
				<text>    Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</text>
				<text>    Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</text>
			</feature>
			<feature>
				<name>Fighting Style</name>
				<text>At 2nd level, you adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options: Archery, Defense, Dueling, Mariner, or Two-Weapon Fighting. You can't take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.</text>

			</feature>
			<feature optional="YES">
				<name>Ranger Archetype: Deep Stalker</name>
				<text>Many Deep Stalkers are elves, as those folk know all too well the threat posed by the drow. Deep Stalkers scout for new passages into the Underdark, carefully mapping them and working
to ensure they remain watched at all times. They venture into the depths on long, dangerous patrols, disappearing for months at a time. Many of them never return. Deep Stalkers master spells useful in navigating the Underdark, and their combat tactics focus on ambush, surprise, and stealth. They fight alone or in small groups in hostile territory, relying on clever tactics to carry the day.</text>

Its hit point maximum equals its normal maximum or four times your ranger level, whichever is higher.</text>
				<text>    The beast obeys your commands as best as it can. It takes its turn on your initiative, though it doesn't take an action unless you command it to. On your turn, you can verbally command the beast where to move (no action required by you). You can use your action to verbally command it to take the Attack, Dash, Disengage, Dodge, or Help action. Once you have the Extra Attack feature, you can make one weapon attack yourself when you command the beast to take the Attack action.</text>

				<name>Spellcasting</name>
				<text>An event in your past, or in the life of a parent or ancestor, left an indelible mark on you, infusing you with arcane magic. This font of magic, whatever its origin, fuels your spells. See chapter 10 for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 11 for the sorcerer spell list.</text>
				<text />
				<text>Cantrips</text>
				<text>At 1st level, you know four cantrips of your choice from the sorcerer spell list. You learn an additional sorcerer cantrip of your choice at 4th level and another at 10th level.</text>
				<text />
				<text>Spell Slots</text>
				<text>The Sorcerer table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these sorcerer spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</text>
				<text>    For example, if you know the 1st-level spell burning hands and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast burning hands using either slot.</text>
				<text />
				<text>Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher</text>
				<text>You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the sorcerer spell list.</text>
				<text>    You learn an additional sorcerer spell of your choice at each level except 12th, 14th, 16th, 18th, 19th, and 20th. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 3rd level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.</text>
				<text>    Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the sorcerer spells you know and replace it with another spell from the sorcerer spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</text>
				<text />
				<text>Spellcasting Ability</text>
				<text>Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your sorcerer spells, since the power of your magic relies on your ability to project your will into the world. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a sorcerer spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</text>
				<text>    Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</text>
				<text>    Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</text>
			</feature>
			<feature>
				<name>Sorcerous Origin</name>
				<text>Choose a sorcerous origin, which describes the source of your innate magical power: Draconic Bloodline, Wild Magic, Favored Soul, or Storm Sorcerer.</text>
				<text>    Your choice grants you features when you choose it at 1st level and again at 6th, 14th, and 18th level.</text>
			</feature>
			<feature optional="YES">
				<name>Sorcerous Origin: Draconic Bloodline</name>
				<text>Your innate magic comes from draconic magic that was mingled with your blood or that of your ancestors. Most often, sorcerers with this origin trace their descent back to a mighty sorcerer of ancient times who made a bargain with a dragon or who might even have claimed a dragon parent. Some of these bloodlines are well established in the world, but most are obscure. Any given sorcerer could be the first of a new bloodline, as a result of a pact or some other exceptional circumstance.</text>
			</feature>
			<feature optional="YES">
				<name>Sorcerous Origin: Wild Magic</name>
				<text>Your innate magic comes from the wild forces of chaos that underlie the order of creation. You might have endured exposure to some form of raw magic, perhaps through a planar portal leading to Limbo, the Elemental Planes, or the mysterious Far Realm. Perhaps you were blessed by a powerful fey creature or marked by a demon. Or your magic could be a fluke of your birth, with no apparent cause or reason. However it came to be, this chaotic magic churns within you, waiting for any outlet.</text>
			</feature>
			<feature optional="YES">
				<name>Sorcerous Origin: Favored Soul</name>
				<text>You have been chosen by a deity, and bestowed with a fragment of their divine power. You have been fundamentally changed by the touch of this deity, which awakens powerful magical abilities inside you</text>
			</feature>
			<feature optional="YES">
				<name>Sorcerous Origin: Storm</name>
				<text>Your innate magic comes from the power of elemental air. Perhaps you were born during a howling gale so powerful that folk still tell stories of it. Your lineage might include the influence of potent air creatures such as vaati or djinni. Whatever the case, the magic of the storm permeates your soul.</text>
				<text />
				<text>Storm sorcerers are invaluable members of a ship's crew. Their magic allows them to exert control over wind and weather in their immediate area. Their abilities also prove useful in repelling attacks by sahuagin, pirates, and other waterborne threats.</text>
			</feature>
			<feature optional="YES">
				<name>Sorcerous Origin: Shadow</name>
				<text>Your innate magic comes from the Shadowfell. You might trace your lineage to an entity from that place, or perhaps you were exposed to its fell energy and transformed in some fundamental manner.</text>
				<text />
				<text>    The power of shadow magic casts a strange pall over your physical presence. The spark of life that sustains you is muffled, as if it struggles to remain viable against the dark energy that imbues your soul. At your option, you can pick from or roll on the following table to create a unique quirk for your character.</text>
				<text />
				<text>d6 - Quirk</text>
				<text>1 — You are always icy cold to the touch.</text>
				<text>2 — When you are asleep, you don't appear to breathe (though you must still breathe to survive).</text>
				<text>3 — You don't seem to bleed, even when badly injured.</text>
				<text>4 — Your heart beats once per minute. This even sometimes surprises you.</text>

				<name>The Undying: Among the Dead</name>
				<text>Starting at 1st level, you learn the spare the dying cantrip, which counts as a warlock cantrip for you. You also have advantage on saving throws against any disease.</text>
				<text>    Additionally, undead have difficulty harming you. If an undead targets you directly with an attack or a harmful spell, that creature must make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC (an undead needn't make the save when it includes you in an area effect, such as the explosion of fireball). On a failed save, the creature must choose a new target or forfeit targeting someone instead of you, potentially wasting the attack or spell. On a succesful save, the creature is immune to this effect for 24 hours. An undead is also immune to this effect for 24 hours if you target it with an attack or a harmful spell.</text>
			</feature>
			<feature optional="YES">
				<name>The Undying Light: Radiant Soul</name>
				<text>Starting at 1st level, your link to the Positive Plane allows you to serve as a conduit for radiant energy. You have resistance to radiant damage, and when you cast a spell that deals radiant damage or fire damage, you add your Charisma modifier to that damage. Additionally, you know the sacred flame and light cantrips and can cast them at will. They don't count against your number of cantrips known.</text>
			</feature>
			<feature>
				<name>Pact Magic</name>
				<text>Your arcane research and the magic bestowed on you by your patron have given you facility with spells. See chapter 10 for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 11 for the warlock spell list.</text>
				<text />
				<text>Cantrips</text>
				<text>You know two cantrips of your choice from the warlock spell list. You learn additional warlock cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Warlock table.</text>
				<text />
				<text>Spell Slots</text>
				<text>The Warlock table shows how many spell slots you have. The table also shows what the level of those slots is; all of your spell slots are the same level. To cast one of your warlock spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a spell slot. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a short or long rest.</text>
				<text>    For example, when you are 5th level, you have two 3rd-level spell slots. To cast the 1st-level spell thunderwave, you must spend one of those slots, and you cast it as a 3rd-level spell.</text>
				<text />
				<text>Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher</text>
				<text>At 1st level, you know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the warlock spell list.</text>
				<text>    You learn a new warlock spell every time you gain a level from 2 through 9, as well as at level 19. A spell you choose must be of a level no higher than what's shown in the table's Slot Level column for your level. When you reach 6th level, for example, you learn a new warlock spell, which can be 1st, 2nd, or 3rd level.</text>
				<text>    Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the warlock spells you know and replace it with another spell from the warlock spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</text>
				<text />
				<text>Spellcasting Ability</text>
				<text>Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your warlock spells, so you use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a warlock spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</text>
				<text>    Spell save DC: 8 + Proficiency bonus + Charisma modifier</text>
				<text>    Spell attack modifier: Proficiency bonus + Charisma modifier</text>
				<text />
				<text>Spellcasting Focus</text>
				<text>You can use an arcane focus (found in chapter 5) as a spellcasting focus for your warlock spells.</text>

			<feature>
				<name>Eldritch Invocations</name>
				<text>In your study of occult lore, you have unearthed eldritch invocations, fragments of forbidden knowledge that imbue you with an abiding magical ability.</text>
				<text>    At 2nd level, you gain two eldritch invocations of your choice. Your invocation options are detailed at the end of the class description. When you gain certain warlock levels, you gain additional invocations of your choice.</text>
				<text>    Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the invocations you know and replace it with another invocation that you could learn at that level. A level prerequisite in an invocation refers to warlock level, not character level.</text>
			</feature>

				<name>Pact Boon: Pact of the Chain</name>
				<text>You learn the find familiar spell and can cast it as a ritual. The spell doesn't count against your number of spells known.</text>
				<text>    When you cast the spell, you can choose one of the normal forms for your familiar or one of the following special forms: imp, pseudodragon, quasit, or sprite.</text>
				<text>    Additionally, when you take the Attack action, you can forgo one of your own attacks to allow your familiar to use its reaction to make one attack of its own.</text>
			</feature>
			<feature optional="YES">
				<name>Pact Boon: Pact of the Blade</name>
				<text>You can use your action to create a pact weapon in your empty hand. You can choose the form that this melee weapon takes each time you create it (see chapter 5 for weapon options). You are proficient with it while you wield it. This weapon counts as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.</text>
				<text>    Your pact weapon disappears if it is more than 5 feet away from you for 1 minute or more. It also disappears if you use this feature again, if you dismiss the weapon (no action required), or if you die.</text>
				<text>    You can transform one magic weapon into your pact weapon by performing a special ritual while you hold the weapon. You perform the ritual over the course of 1 hour, which can be done during a short rest. You can then dismiss the weapon, shunting it into an extradimensional space, and it appears whenever you create your pact weapon thereafter. You can't affect an artifact or a sentient weapon in this way. The weapon ceases being your pact weapon if you die, if you perform the 1-hour ritual on a different weapon, or if you use a 1-hour ritual to break your bond to it. The weapon appears at your feet if it is in the extradimensional space when the bond breaks.</text>
			</feature>
			<feature optional="YES">
				<name>Pact Boon: Pact of the Tome</name>
				<text>Your patron gives you a grimoire called a Book of Shadows. When you gain this feature, choose three cantrips from any class's spell list. The cantrips do not need to be from the same spell list. While the book is on your person, you can cast those cantrips at will. They don't count against your number of cantrips known. Any cantrip you cast with this feature is considered a warlock cantrip for you. If you lose your Book of Shadows, you can perform a 1-hour ceremony to receive a replacement from your patron. This ceremony can be performed during a short or long rest, and it destroys the previous book. The book turns to ash when you die.</text>

				<name>Arcane Recovery</name>
				<text>You have learned to regain some of your magical energy by studying your spellbook. Once per day when you finish a short rest, you can choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level that is equal to or less than half your wizard level (rounded up), and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher.</text>
				<text>    For example, if you're a 4th-level wizard, you can recover up to two levels worth of spell slots.</text>
				<text>    You can recover either a 2nd-level spell slot or two 1st-level spell slots.</text>
			</feature>
			<feature>
				<name>Spellcasting</name>
				<text>As a student of arcane magic, you have a spellbook containing spells that show the first glimmerings of your true power. See chapter 10 for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 11 for the wizard spell list.</text>
				<text />
				<text>Cantrips</text>
				<text>At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list. You learn additional wizard cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Wizard table.</text>
				<text />
				<text>Spellbook</text>
				<text>At 1st level, you have a spellbook containing six 1st-level wizard spells of your choice. Your spellbook is the repository of the wizard spells you know, except your cantrips, which are fixed in your mind.</text>
				<text />
				<text>Preparing and Casting Spells</text>
				<text>The Wizard table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</text>
				<text>    You prepare the list of wizard spells that are available for you to cast. To do so, choose a number of wizard spells from your spellbook equal to your Intelligence modifier + your wizard level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</text>
				<text>    For example, if you're a 3rd-level wizard, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With an Intelligence of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination, chosen from your spellbook. If you prepare the 1st-level spell magic missile, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells.</text>
				<text>    You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of wizard spells requires time spent studying your spellbook and memorizing the incantations and gestures you must make to cast the spell: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</text>
				<text />
				<text>Spellcasting Ability</text>
				<text>Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your wizard spells, since you learn your spells through dedicated study and memorization. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a wizard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</text>
				<text>    Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</text>
				<text>    Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</text>
				<text />
				<text>Ritual Casting</text>
				<text>You can cast a wizard spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell in your spellbook. You don't need to have the spell prepared.</text>
				<text />
				<text>Spellcasting Focus</text>
				<text>You can use an arcane focus (found in chapter 5) as a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells.</text>

				<name>Arcane Tradition</name>
				<text>When you reach 2nd level, you choose an arcane tradition, shaping your practice of magic through one of eight schools: Abjuration, Bladesinging, Conjuration, Divination, Enchantment, Evocation, Illusion, Necromancy, or Transmutation, all detailed at the end of the class description. Your choice grants you features at 2nd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level.</text>
			</feature>
			<feature optional="YES">
				<name>Arcane Tradition: Artificer</name>
				<text>Artificers are a key part of the world of Eberron. They illustrate the evolution of magic from a wild, unpredictable force to one that is becoming available to the masses. Magic items are part of everyday life in the Five Nations of Khorvaire; with an artificer in your party, they become part of every adventuring expedition.</text>
				<text />
				<text>The artificer was a separate class in prior editions of the Eberron setting, a melee combatant who specialized in mystically enhanced arms and armor. The fifth edition rules treat the artificer as a new wizard tradition that focuses on mystical invention, which you can choose starting at 2nd level.</text>
			</feature>
			<feature optional="YES">
				<name>Arcane Tradition: Abjuration</name>
				<text>The School of Abjuration emphasizes magic that blocks, banishes, or protects. Detractors of this school say that its tradition is about denial, negation rather than positive assertion. You understand, however, that ending harmful effects, protecting the weak, and banishing evil influences is anything but a philosophical void. It is a proud and respected vocation.</text>
				<text />
				<text>Called abjurers, members of this school are sought when baleful spirits require exorcism, when important locations must be guarded against magical spying, and when portals to other planes of existence must be closed.</text>
			</feature>
			<feature optional="YES">
				<name>Arcane Tradition: Conjuration</name>
				<text>As a conjurer, you favor spells that produce objects and creatures out of thin air. You can conjure billowing clouds of killing fog or summon creatures from elsewhere to fight on your behalf. As your mastery grows, you learn spells of transportation and can teleport yourself across vast distances, even to other planes of existence, in an instant.</text>
			</feature>
			<feature optional="YES">
				<name>Arcane Tradition: Divination</name>
				<text>The counsel of a diviner is sought by royalty and commoners alike, for all seek a clearer understanding of the past, present, and future. As a diviner, you strive to part the veils of space, time, and consciousness so that you can see clearly. You work to master spells of discernment, remote viewing, supernatural knowledge, and foresight.</text>
			</feature>
			<feature optional="YES">
				<name>Arcane Tradition: Enchantment</name>
				<text>As a member of the School of Enchantment, you have honed your ability to magically entrance and beguile other people and monsters. Some enchanters are peacemakers who bewitch the violent to lay down their arms and charm the cruel into showing mercy. Others are tyrants who magically bind the unwilling into their service. Most enchanters fall somewhere in between.</text>
			</feature>
			<feature optional="YES">
				<name>Arcane Tradition: Evocation</name>
				<text>You focus your study on magic that creates powerful elemental effects such as bitter cold, searing flame, rolling thunder, crackling lightning, and burning acid. Some evokers find employment in military forces, serving as artillery to blast enemy armies from afar.

				<name>Arcane Tradition: Illusion</name>
				<text>You focus your studies on magic that dazzles the senses, befuddles the mind, and tricks even the wisest folk. Your magic is subtle, but the illusions crafted by your keen mind make the impossible seem real. Some illusionists - including many gnome wizards - are benign tricksters who use their spells to entertain. Others are more sinister masters of deception, using their illusions to frighten and fool others for their personal gain.</text>

				<name>Arcane Tradition: Transmutation</name>
				<text>You are a student of spells that modify energy and matter. To you, the world is not a fixed thing, but eminently mutable, and you delight in being an agent of change. You wield the raw stuff of creation and learn to alter both physical forms and mental qualities. Your magic gives you the tools to become a smith on reality's forge.</text>
				<text />
				<text>Some transmuters are tinkerers and pranksters, turning people into toads and transforming copper into silver for fun and occasional profit. Others pursue their magical studies with deadly seriousness, seeking the power of the gods to make and destroy worlds.</text>

				<name>Arcane Tradition: Necromancy</name>
				<text>The School of Necromancy explores the cosmic forces of life, death, and undeath. As you focus your studies in this tradition, you learn to manipulate the energy that animates all living things. As you progress, you learn to sap the life force from a creature as your magic destroys its body, transforming that vital energy into magical power you can manipulate.</text>
				<text />
				<text>Most people see necromancers as menacing, or even villainous, due to the close association with death. Not all necromancers are evil, but the forces they manipulate are considered taboo by many societies.</text>

				<name>School of Abjuration: Arcane Ward</name>
				<text>Starting at 2nd level, you can weave magic around yourself for protection. When you cast an abjuration spell of 1st level or higher, you can simultaneously use a strand of the spell's magic to create a magical ward on yourself that lasts until you finish a long rest. The ward has hit points equal to twice your wizard level + your Intelligence modifier. Whenever you take damage, the ward takes the damage instead. If this damage reduces the ward to 0 hit points, you take any remaining damage.</text>
				<text>    While the ward has 0 hit points, it can't absorb damage, but its magic remains. Whenever you cast an abjuration spell of 1st level or higher, the ward regains a number of hit points equal to twice the level of the spell.</text>

The charmed creature's speed drops to 0, and the creature is incapacitated and visibly dazed.</text>
				<text>    On subsequent turns, you can use your action to maintain this effect, extending its duration until the end of your next turn. However, the effect ends if you move more than 5 feet away from the creature, if the creature can neither see nor hear you, or if the creature takes damage.</text>

Once you have expended a spell slot to create a potion, you cannot regain that slot until the potion is consumed or after 1 week, at which time the potion loses its effectiveness. You can create up to three potions at a time; creating a fourth potion causes the oldest currently active one to immediately lose its potency. If that potion has been consumed, its effects immediately end.</text>

The attacker must make a Wisdom saving throw against your wizard spell save DC. On a failed save, the attacker must target the creature that is closest to it, not including you or itself. If multiple creatures are closest, the attacker chooses which one to target. On a successful save, you can't use this feature on the attacker again until you finish a long rest.</text>
