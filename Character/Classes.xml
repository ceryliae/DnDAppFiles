			<feature>
				<name>Favored Enemy</name>
				<text>Beginning at 1st level, you have significant experience studying, tracking, hunting, and even talking to a certain type of enemy.</text>
				<text>	Choose a type of favored enemy: aberrations, beasts, celestials, constructs, dragons, elementals, fey, fiends, giants, monstrosities, oozes, plants, or undead. Alternatively, you can select two races of humanoid (such as gnolls and orcs) as favored enemies.</text>
				<text>	You have advantage on Wisdom (Survival) checks to track your favored enemies, as well as on Intelligence checks to recall information about them.</text>
				<text>	When you gain this feature, you also learn one language of your choice that is spoken by your favored enemies, if they speak one at all.</text>
				<text>	You choose one additional favored enemy, as well as an associated language, at 6th and 14th level. As you gain levels, your choices should reflect the types of monsters you have encountered on your adventures.</text>
			</feature>
			<feature>
				<name>Natural Explorer</name>
				<text>You are particularly familiar with one type of natural environment and are adept at traveling and surviving in such regions. Choose one type of favored terrain: arctic, coast, desert, forest, grassland, mountain, swamp, or the Underdark. When you make an Intelligence or Wisdom check related to your favored terrain, your proficiency bonus is doubled if you are using a skill that you're proficient in.</text>
				<text>	While traveling for an hour or more in your favored terrain, you gain the following benefits:</text>
				<text/>
				<text>• Difficult terrain doesn't slow your group's travel.</text>
				<text>• Your group can't become lost except by magical means.</text>
				<text>• Even when you are engaged in another activity while traveling (such as foraging, navigating, or tracking), you remain alert to danger.</text>
				<text>• If you are traveling alone, you can move stealthily at a normal pace.</text>
				<text>• When you forage, you find twice as much food as you normally would.</text>
				<text>• While tracking other creatures, you also learn their exact number, their sizes, and how long ago they passed through the area.</text>
				<text/>
				<text>	You choose additional favored terrain types at 6th and 10th level.</text>
			</feature>
		</autolevel>
		<autolevel level="2">
			<feature>
				<name>Spellcasting</name>
				<text>By the time you reach 2nd level, you have learned to use the magical essence of nature to cast spells, much as a druid does. See chapter 10 for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 11 for the ranger spell list. </text>
				<text/>
				<text>Spell Slots</text>
				<text>The Ranger table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</text>
				<text>	For example, if you know the 1st-level spell animal friendship and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast animal friendship using either slot. </text>
				<text/>
				<text>Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher</text>
				<text>You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the ranger spell list.</text>
				<text>	You learn an additional ranger spell of your choice at each odd numbered level thereafter. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 5th level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.</text>
				<text>	Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the ranger spells you know and replace it with another spell from the ranger spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots. </text>
				<text/>
				<text>Spellcasting Ability</text>
				<text>Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your ranger spells, since your magic draws on your attunement to nature. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a ranger spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</text>
				<text>	Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</text>
				<text>	Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</text>
			</feature>
			<feature>
				<name>Fighting Style</name>
				<text>At 2nd level, you adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options: Archery, Defense, Dueling, Mariner, or Two-Weapon Fighting. You can't take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.</text>

			</feature>
			<feature optional="YES">
				<name>Fighting Style: Two-Weapon Fighting</name>
				<text>When you engage in two-weapon fighting, you can add your ability modifier to the damage of the second attack.</text>
			</feature>
		</autolevel>
		<autolevel level="3">
			<feature>
				<name>Ranger Archetype</name>

			</feature>
			<feature optional="YES">
				<name>Ranger Archetype: Hunter</name>
				<text>Emulating the Hunter archetype means accepting your place as a bulwark between civilization and the terrors of the wilderness. As you walk the Hunter's path, you learn specialized techniques for fighting the threats you face, from rampaging ogres and hordes of orcs to towering giants and terrifying dragons.</text>
			</feature>
			<feature optional="YES">
				<name>Ranger Archetype: Beast Master</name>
				<text>The Beast Master archetype embodies a friendship between the civilized races and the beasts of the world. United in focus, beast and ranger work as one to fight the monstrous foes that threaten civilization and the wilderness alike. Emulating the Beast Master archetype means committing yourself to this ideal, working in partnership with an animal as its companion and friend.</text>
			</feature>
			<feature optional="YES">
				<name>Hunter: Hunter's Prey</name>
				<text>At 3rd level, you gain one of the following features of your choice: Colossus Slayer, Giant Killer, or Horde Breaker.</text>
			</feature>
			<feature optional="YES">
				<name>Hunter's Prey: Colossus Slayer</name>
				<text>Your tenacity can wear down the most potent foes. When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, the creature takes an extra 1d8 damage if it's below its hit point maximum. You can deal this extra damage only once per turn.</text>
			</feature>
			<feature optional="YES">
				<name>Hunter's Prey: Giant Killer</name>
				<text>When a Large or larger creature within 5 feet of you hits or misses you with an attack, you can use your reaction to attack that creature immediately after its attack, provided that you can see the creature.</text>
			</feature>
			<feature optional="YES">
				<name>Hunter's Prey: Horde Breaker</name>
				<text>Once on each of your turns when you make a weapon attack, you can make another attack with the same weapon against a different creature that is within 5 feet of the original target and within range of your weapon.</text>
			</feature>
			<feature optional="YES">
				<name>Beast Master: Ranger's Companion</name>
				<text>You gain a beast companion that accompanies you on your adventures and is trained to fight alongside you. Choose a beast that is no larger than Medium and that has a challenge rating of 1/4 or lower. Add your proficiency bonus to the beast's AC, attack rolls, and damage rolls, as well as to any saving throws and skills it is proficient in. Its hit point maximum equals its normal maximum or four times your ranger level, whichever is higher.</text>
				<text>	The beast obeys your commands as best as it can. It takes its turn on your initiative, though it doesn't take an action unless you command it to. On your turn, you can verbally command the beast where to move (no action required by you). You can use your action to verbally command it to take the Attack, Dash, Disengage, Dodge, or Help action. Once you have the Extra Attack feature, you can make one weapon attack yourself when you command the beast to take the Attack action.</text>
				<text>	If you are incapacitated or absent, your beast companion acts on its own, focusing on protecting you and itself. It never requires your command to use its reaction, such as when making an opportunity attack.</text>
				<text>	Like any creature, the beast can spend hit dice during a short rest.</text>
				<text>	While traveling through your favored terrain with only the beast, you can move stealthily at a normal pace.</text>
				<text>	If the beast dies, you can obtain another one by spending 8 hours magically bonding with another beast that isn't hostile to you, either the same type of beast as before or a different one.</text>
			</feature>
			<feature>

				<text>Rangers of the Primeval Guardian Conclave follow an ancient tradition rooted in powerful druidic magic. These rangers learn to become one with nature, allowing them to channel the aspects of various beasts and plants in order to overcome their foes. </text>

				<text/>
				<text>This Ranger Archetype is from Unearthed Arcana: Ranger and Rogue, and as such may not be allowed in your game. Consult your DM before choosing this option.</text>
