		<autolevel level="1">
			<feature optional="YES">
				<name>Sorcerous Origin: Favored Soul (UA)</name>
				<text>Sometimes the spark of magic that fuels a sorcerer comes from a divine source that glimmers within the soul. Having such a favored soul, your innate magic might come from a distant but powerful familial connection to a divine being. Perhaps your ancestor was an angel, transformed into a mortal and sent to fight in a god's name. Or your birth might align with an ancient prophecy, marking you as a servant of the gods or a chosen vessel of divine magic.</text>
				<text>	Favored souls, with their natural magnetism and strong personalities, are often seen as threats by traditional religious hierarchies. As outsiders who command the power of the gods, these sorcerers can undermine the existing order and claim a direct tie to the divine.</text>
				<text>	In some cultures, only those who can claim the power of a favored soul may command religious power. In these lands, ecclesiastical positions are dominated by a few bloodlines and preserved over generations.</text>
				<text>	</text>
				<text>This sorcerous Origin is from Unearthed Arcana: Sorcerer and as such may not be allowed in your game. Consult your DM before choosing this class option.</text>
				<text>Another version of Favored Soul appeared in the earlier Unearthed Arcana: Class Design Variants (melee-combat focused)</text>
			</feature>
			<feature optional="YES">
				<name>Favored Soul: Divine Magic</name>
				<text>Your link to the divine allows you to learn spells normally associated with the cleric class. When your Spellcasting feature lets you learn a sorcerer cantrip or a sorcerer spell of 1st level or higher, you can choose the new spell from the cleric spell list, in addition to the sorcerer spell list. You must otherwise obey all the restrictions for selecting the spell, and it becomes a sorcerer spell for you.</text>

				<name>Favored Soul: Supernatural Resilience</name>
				<text>At 1st level, the blessing of the gods grants you enhanced durability. Your hit point maximum increases by 1, and it increases by 1 again whenever you gain a level in this class.</text>
				<text>	</text>

			<feature optional="YES">
				<name>Favored Soul: Favored by the Gods</name>
				<text>Starting at 1st level, divine power guards your destiny. If you fail a saving throw or miss with an attack roll, you can roll 2d4 and add it to the total, possibly changing the outcome.</text>
				<text>	Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</text>
