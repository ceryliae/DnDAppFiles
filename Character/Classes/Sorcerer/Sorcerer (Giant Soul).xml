				<name>Sorcerous Origin: Giant Soul Sorcery (UA)</name>
				<text>The giants once dwelled in a fabled realm known as Ostoria, a paradise for their folk that reflected their mastery of the mortal realm. In time, Ostoria fell, and the giants were scattered and broken. During that mythic era, the giants granted a few chosen individuals among the small folk a shard of their great power. These favored people were caught in the same tragedy that sundered Ostoria. Since that time, they have spread across the many worlds of the multiverse. Now and again, one of their descendants manifests the gifts imparted by the giants, granting them sorcerous magic that allows them to command the elements and gain the might of a giant.</text>

				<text>This sorcerous Origin is from Unearthed Arcana: Giant Soul Sorcerer and as such may not be allowed in your game. Consult your DM before choosing this class option.</text>
