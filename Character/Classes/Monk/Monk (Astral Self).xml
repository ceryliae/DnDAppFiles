				<name>Monastic Tradition: Way of Astral Self (UA)</name>
				<text>Monks of the Way of the Astral Self have an internal struggle with their ki. They see theirmystical energy as a representation of their true form, an astral self. This form has the capacity to be a force of good or destruction, with some monasteries training students to either temper their nature or embrace their impulses. </text>
				<text/>
				<text>This Monastic Tradition is from Unearthed Arcana: Barbarian and Monk, and as such may not be allowed in your game. Consult your DM before choosing this option.</text>

			<feature optional="YES">
				<name>Way of Astral Self: Arms of the Astral Self</name>
				<text>At 3rd level, your mastery of your ki allows you to summon a portion of your astral self. On your turn, you can spend 2 ki points as a bonus action to summon the arms of your astral self for 10 minutes. These spectral arms hover near your shoulders. You determine the arms' appearance based on the qualities of your character.</text>
				<text>	While your astral arms are summoned, you gain the following benefits:</text>
				<text>• You can use your Wisdom modifier in place of your Strength modifier when making Strength checks and Strength saving throws.</text>
				<text>• The arms are monk weapons and have a reach of 10 feet. The arms deal radiant or necrotic damage (your choice). When you attack with the arms, you can use your Wisdom modifier instead of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls.</text>
				<text>• Immediately after you use the Attack action with your astral arms on your turn, you can make one extra attack with your astral arms as a bonus action. The number of extra attacks increases when you reach certain levels in this class, increasing to two at 11th level and three at 17th level.</text>

				<name>Way of Astral Self: Visage of the Astral Self</name>
				<text>Starting at 6th level, you can summon the visage of your astral self. On your turn, you can spend 1 ki point as a bonus action, or as part of summoning your astral arms, to summon this visage for 10 minutes. The spectral visage covers your face like a helmet or mask. You determine its appearance based on the qualities of your character.</text>

				<text>	Wisdom of the Spirit. You have advantage on Wisdom (Insight) and Charisma (Intimidation) checks.</text>

				<text>	Empowered Arms. Once on each of your turns when you hit a target with your astral arms, you can deal extra damage to the target equal to your Martial Arts die.</text>
				<text>	Word of the Spirit. When you speak through your visage, you can direct your words to a creature of your choice that you can see within 30 feet of you, making it so only that creature can hear you. Alternatively, you can amplify your voice so that all creatures within 600 feet can hear you.</text>
