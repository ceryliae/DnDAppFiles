            <feature optional="YES">
                <name>Monastic Tradition: Way of the Kensei (UA)</name>
                <text>Monks of the Way of Kensei train relentlessly with their weapons, to the point that the weapon becomes like an extension of the body. A kensei sees a weapon in much the same way a painter regards a brush or a writer sees parchment, ink, and quill. A sword or bow is a tool used to express the beauty and elegance of the martial arts. That such mastery makes a kensei a peerless warrior is but a side effect of intense devotion, practice, and study.</text>
                <text />
                <text>This Monastic Tradition is from Unearthed Arcana: Revised Subclasses, and as such may not be allowed in your game. Consult your DM before choosing this option.</text>
				<text>	This had an earlier version included in Unearthed Arcana: Monk Monastic Traditions</text>

            <feature optional="YES">
                <name>Way of the Kensei: Path of the Kensei</name>
                <text>When you choose this tradition at 3rd level, your special martial arts training leads you to master the use of certain weapons.</text>
                <text>	You gain the following benefits: </text>
                <text />
                <text>• Choose two types of weapons to be your kensei weapons: one melee weapon and one ranged weapon.</text>
				<text>Each of these weapons can be any simple or martial weapon that lacks the heavy and special properties. The longbow is also a valid choice.</text>
				<text>You gain proficiency with these weapons if you don’t already have it. Weapons of the chosen types are monk weapons for you. </text>
				<text>Many of this tradition’s features work only with your kensei weapons.</text>
				<text>When you reach 6th, 11th, and 17th level in this class, you can choose another type of weapon—melee or ranged—to be a kensei weapon for you, following the criteria above.</text>
                <text />
				<text>• If you make an unarmed strike as part of the Attack action on your turn and are holding a kensei weapon, you can use it to defend yourself if it is a melee weapon.</text>
				<text>You gain a +2 bonus to AC until the start of your next turn, while the weapon is in your hand and you aren't incapacitated.</text>
                <text />
                <text>• You can use a bonus action on your turn to make your ranged attacks with a kensei weapon more deadly.</text>
				<text>When you do so, any target you hit with a ranged attack using a kensei weapon takes an extra 1d4 damage of the weapon’s type.</text>
				<text>You retain this benefit until the end of the current turn.</text>

                <text>	When you hit a target with a kensei weapon, you can spend 1 ki point to cause the weapon to deal extra damage to the target equal to your Martial Arts die. You can use this feature only once on each of your turns.</text>
