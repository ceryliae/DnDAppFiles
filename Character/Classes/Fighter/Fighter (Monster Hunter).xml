				<text>When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain a set of abilities that are fueled by special dice called superiority dice.</text>
				<text/>
				<text>Superiority Dice:</text>
				<text>You have four superiority dice, which are d8s. A superiority die is expended when you use it. You regain all of your expended superiority dice when you finish a short or long rest.</text>
				<text>	You gain another superiority die at 7th level and one more at 15th level.</text>
				<text/>
				<text>Using Superiority Dice:</text>
				<text>You can expend superiority dice to gain a number of different benefits:</text>
				<text/>
				<text>• When you make a weapon attack against a creature, you can expend one superiority die to add it to the attack roll. You can use this ability before or after making the attack roll, but before any of the effects of the attack are applied.</text>
				<text/>
				<text>• When you damage a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to add it to the damage roll. You can use this ability after rolling damage. If the attack causes the target to make a Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration, it has disadvantage on that save.</text>
				<text/>
				<text>• When you make an Intelligence, a Wisdom, or a Charisma saving throw, you can expend one superiority die to add it to the roll. You can use this feature only before you learn if the save succeeded or failed.</text>
				<text/>
				<text>• When you make a Wisdom (Perception) check to detect a hidden creature or object, or a Wisdom (Insight) check to determine if someone is lying to you, you can expend one superiority die to add it to the roll. You can use this feature after seeing the total but before learning if you succeeded or failed.</text>
