	  <feature optional="YES">
		<name>Martial Archetype: Sharpshooter (UA)</name>
		<text>The Sharpshooter is a master of ranged combat. An excellent sniper and eagle-eyed scout, this fighter is a perilous foe who can defeat an entire war band so long as they are kept at range.</text>
		<text/>
		<text>This Martial Archetype is from Unearthed Arcana: Fighter Martial Archetypes, and as such may not be allowed in your game. Consult your DM before selecting this option.</text>
	  </feature>
	  <feature optional="YES">
		<name>Sharpshooter: Steady Aim</name>
		<text>Beginning when you choose this archetype at 3rd level, your aim becomes deadly. As a bonus action on your turn, you can take careful aim at a creature you can see that is within range of a ranged weapon you're wielding. Until the end of this turn, your ranged attacks with that weapon gain two benefits against the target:</text>
		<text/>
		<text>• The attacks ignore half and three-quarters cover.</text>
		<text/>
		<text>• On each hit, the weapon deals additional damage to the target equal to 2 + half your fighter level.</text>
		<text>	You can use this feature three times. You regain all expended uses of it when you finish a short or long rest.</text>
	  </feature>
	</autolevel>

	<autolevel level="7">
	  <feature optional="YES">
		<name>Sharpshooter: Careful Eyes</name>
		<text>Starting at 7th level, you excel at picking out hidden enemies and other threats. You can take the Search action as a bonus action.</text>
		<text>	You also gain proficiency in the Perception, Investigation, or Survival skill (choose one).</text>
	  </feature>
	</autolevel>

	<autolevel level="10">
	  <feature optional="YES">
		<name>Sharpshooter: Close-Quarters Shooting</name>
		<text>At 10th level, you learn to handle yourself in close combat. Making a ranged attack roll while within 5 feet of an enemy doesn't impose disadvantage on your roll.</text>
		<text>	In addition, if you hit a creature within 5 feet of you with a ranged attack on your turn, that creature can't take reactions until the end of this turn.</text>
	  </feature>
	</autolevel>

	<autolevel level="15">
	  <feature optional="YES">
		<name>Sharpshooter: Rapid Strike</name>
		<text>Starting at 15th level, you learn to trade accuracy for swift strikes. If you have advantage on a weapon attack against a target on your turn, you can forgo that advantage to immediately make an additional weapon attack against the same target as a bonus action.</text>
	  </feature>
	</autolevel>

	<autolevel level="18">
	  <feature optional="YES">
		<name>Sharpshooter: Snap Shot</name>
		<text>Starting at 18th level, you are ever ready to spring into action. If you take the Attack action on your first turn of a combat, you can make one additional ranged weapon attack as part of that action.</text>
