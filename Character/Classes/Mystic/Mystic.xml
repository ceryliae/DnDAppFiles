				<name>Important Notes</name>
				<text>The material here is presented for playtesting and to spark your imagination. </text>
				<text>	These game mechanics are in draft form, usable in your campaign but not refined by design iterations or full game development and editing. </text>
				<text>	They aren't officially part of the game and aren't permitted in DnD Adventurers League events</text>
				<text>	Also, spell slots are organized as such: Cantrips = Number of Talents, Level 1 Slots = Number of Disciplines, Level 2 Slots = Psi Points, Level 3 Slots = Psi Limit</text>
			</feature>
			<feature>
				<name>Psionics</name>
				<text>As a student of psionics, you can master and use psionic talents and disciplines, the rules for which appear at the end of this document. Psionics is a special form of magic use, distinct from spellcasting.</text>
			</feature>
			<feature>
				<name>Psionic Talents</name>
				<text>A psionic talent is a minor psionic effect you have mastered. At 1st level, you know one psionic talent of your choice. You learn additional talents of your choice at higher levels.  The Talents Known column of the Mystic table shows the total number of talents you know at each level; when that number goes up for you, choose a new talent.</text>
			</feature>
			<feature>
				<name>Psionic Disciplines</name>
				<text>A psionic discipline is a rigid set of mental exercises that allows a mystic to manifest psionic power. A mystic masters only a few disciplines at a time. </text>
				<text>	At 1st level, you know one psionic discipline of your choice. The Disciplines Known column of the Mystic table shows the total number of disciplines you know at each level; when that number goes up for you, choose a new discipline.</text>
				<text>	In addition, whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one discipline you know with a different one of your choice.</text>
			</feature>
			<feature>
				<name>Psi Points</name>
				<text>You have an internal reservoir of energy that can be devoted to psionic disciplines you know. This energy is represented by psi points. Each psionic discipline describes effects you can create with it by spending a certain number of psi points. A psionic talent requires no psi points.</text>
				<text>	The number of psi points you have is based on your mystic level, as shown in the Psi Points column of the Mystic table. The number shown for your level is your psi point maximum. Your psi point total returns to its maximum when you finish a long rest. The number of psi points you have can't go below 0 or over your maximum.</text>
			</feature>
			<feature>
				<name>Psi Limit</name>
				<text>Though you have access to a potent amount of psionic energy, it takes training and practice to channel that energy. There is a limit on the number of psi points you can spend to activate a psionic discipline. The limit is based on your mystic level, as shown in the Psi Limit column of the Mystic table. For example, as a 3rd-level mystic, you can spend no more than 3 psi points on a discipline each time you use it, no matter how many psi points you have.</text>

				<name>Psychic Focus</name>
				<text>You can focus psionic energy on one of your psionic disciplines to draw ongoing benefits from it. As a bonus action, you can choose one of your psionic disciplines and gain its psychic focus benefit, which is detailed in that discipline's description. The benefit lasts until you are incapacitated or until you use another bonus action to choose a different focus benefit.</text>
				<text>	You can have only one psychic focus benefit at a time, and using the psychic focus of one discipline doesn't limit your ability to use other disciplines.</text>
			</feature>
			<feature>
				<name>Psionic Ability</name>
				<text>Intelligence is your psionic ability for your psionic disciplines. You use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a psionic discipline or when making an attack roll with one.</text>
				<text>	Discipline save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</text>
				<text>	Discipline attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</text>
			</feature>
			<feature>
				<name>Using Disciplines</name>
				<text>Each psionic discipline has several ways you can use it, all contained in its description. The discipline specifies the type of action and number of psi points it requires. It also details whether you must concentrate on its effects, how many targets it affects, what saving throws it requires, and so on.</text>
				<text>	The following sections go into more detail on using a discipline. Psionic disciplines are magical and function similarly to spells.</text>
				<text/>
				<text>Psychic Focus</text>
				<text>The Psychic Focus section of a discipline describes the benefit you gain when you choose that discipline for your psychic focus.</text>
				<text/>
				<text>Effect Options and Psi Points</text>
				<text>A discipline provides different options for how to use it with your psi points. Each effect option has a name, and the psi point cost of that option appears in parentheses after its name. You must spend that number of psi points to use that option, while abiding by your psi limit. If you don't have enough psi points left, or the cost is above your psi limit, you can't use the option.</text>
				<text>	Some options show a range of psi points, rather than a specific cost. To use that option, you must spend a number of points within that point range, still abiding by your psi limit. Some options let you spend additional psi points to increase a discipline's potency. Again, you must abide by your psi limit, and you must spend all the points when you first use the discipline; you can't decide to spend additional points once you see the discipline in action.</text>
				<text>	Each option notes specific information about its effect, including any action required to use it and its range.</text>
				<text/>
				<text>Components</text>
				<text>Disciplines don't require the components that many spells require. Using a discipline requires no spoken words, gestures, or materials. The power of psionics comes from the mind.</text>
				<text/>
				<text>Duration</text>
				<text>	An option in a discipline specifies how long its effect lasts. Instantaneous: If no duration is specified, the effect of an option is instantaneous. Concentration: Some options require concentration to maintain their effects. This requirement is noted with “Conc” after the option's psi point cost. The “Conc” notation is followed by the maximum duration of the concentration. For example, if an option says “Conc 1m”, you can concentrate on its effect for up to 1 minute, if an option says “Conc 1h,” you can concentrate on its effect for up to 1 hour, and finally if an option says "Conc 1r", you can concentrate on its effect for up to 1 round.</text>
				<text>	Concentrating on a discipline follows the same rules as concentrating on a spell. This rule means you can't concentrate on a spell and a discipline at the same time, nor can you concentrate on two disciplines at the same time. See chapter 10, “Spellcasting,” in the Player's Handbook for how concentration works.</text>
				<text/>
				<text>Targets and Areas of Effect</text>
				<text>Psionic disciplines use the same rules as spells for determining targets and areas of effect. See chapter 10, “Spellcasting,” of the Player's Handbook.</text>
				<text/>
				<text>Saving Throws and Attack Rolls</text>
				<text>If a discipline requires a saving throw, it specifies the type of save and the results of a successful or failed saving throw. The DC is determined by your psionic ability.</text>
				<text>Some disciplines require you to make an attack roll to determine whether the discipline's effect hits its target. The attack roll uses your psionic ability.</text>
				<text/>
				<text>Combining Psionic Effects</text>
				<text>The effects of different psionic disciplines add together while the durations of those disciplines overlap. Likewise, different options from a single psionic discipline combine if they are active at the same time. However, a specific option from a psionic discipline doesn't combine with itself if that option is used multiple times. Instead, the most potent effect — usually dependent on how many psi points were used to create the effect — applies while the durations of the effects overlap.</text>
				<text>	Psionics and magic are separate effects, and therefore their benefits and drawbacks overlap. A psionic effect that reproduces a spell is an exception to this rule (see “Psionics and Magic” earlier, as well as “Combining Magical Effects” in chapter 10, “Spellcasting,” of the Player's Handbook).</text>
			</feature>
			<feature>
				<name>Mystic Order</name>
				<text>At 1st level, you choose a Mystic Order: the Order of the Avatar, the Order of the Awakened, the Order of the Immortal, the Order of the Nomad, the Order of the Soul Knife, or the Order of the Wu Jen, each of which is detailed at the end of the class description. Each order specializes in a specific approach to psionics.</text>
				<text>Your order gives you features when you choose it at 1st level and additional features at 3rd, 6th, and 14th level.</text>
			</feature>
			<feature optional="YES">
				<name>Order of the Avatar</name>
				<text>Mystics of the Order of the Avatar delve into the world of emotion, mastering their inner life to such an extent that they can manipulate and amplify the emotions of others with the same ease that an artist shapes clay. Known as Avatars, these mystics vary from tyrants to inspiring leaders who are loved by their followers.</text>
				<text>	Avatars can bring out extreme emotions in the people around them. For their allies, they can lend hope, ferocity, and courage, transforming a fighting band into a deadly, unified force. For their enemies, they bring fear, disgust, and trepidation that can make even the most hardened veteran act like a shaky rookie.</text>
				<text/>
				<text>Bonus Disciplines</text>
				<text>At 1st level, you learn two additional psionic disciplines of your choice. They must be chosen from among the Avatar disciplines.</text>
				<text/>

				<text>At 1st level, you gain proficiency with medium armor and shields.</text>
			</feature>
			<feature optional="YES">
				<name>Order of the Awakened</name>
				<text>Mystics dedicated to the Order of the Awakened seek to unlock the full potential of the mind. By transcending the physical, the Awakened hope to attain a perfect state of being — focused on pure intellect and mental energy.</text>
				<text>	The Awakened are skilled at bending minds and unleashing devastating psychic attacks, and are able to read the secrets of the world through psionic energy. Awakened mystics who take to adventuring excel at unraveling mysteries, solving puzzles, and defeating monsters by turning them into unwilling pawns.</text>
				<text/>
				<text>Bonus Disciplines</text>
				<text>At 1st level, you learn two additional psionic disciplines of your choice. They must be chosen from among the Awakened disciplines.</text>

				<text/>
				<text>Awakened Expertise</text>
				<text>Mystics dedicated to the Order of the Awakened seek to unlock the full potential of the mind. By transcending the physical, the Awakened hope to attain a state of being focused on pure intellect and mental energy.</text>
				<text/>
				<text>The Awakened are skilled at bending minds and unleashing devastating psionic attacks, and they can read the secrets of the world through psionic energy. Awakened mystics who take to adventuring excel at unraveling mysteries, solving puzzles, and defeating monsters by turning them into unwilling pawns.</text>
				<text>	In addition, choose one skill you are proficient in. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses that skill.</text>
			</feature>
			<feature optional="YES">
				<name>Order of the Immortal</name>
				<text>The Order of the Immortal uses psionic energy to augment and modify the physical form. Followers of this order are known as Immortals. They use psionic energy to modify their bodies, strengthening them against attack and turning themselves into living weapons.</text>
				<text>	Their mastery of the physical form grants them their name, for Immortals are notoriously difficult to kill.</text>
				<text/>
				<text>Bonus Disciplines </text>
				<text>At 1st level, you learn two additional psionic disciplines of your choice. They must be chosen from among the Immortal disciplines.</text>
				<text/>
				<text>Immortal Durability</text>
				<text>Starting at 1st level, your hit point maximum increases by 1 per mystic level.</text>
				<text>	  In addition, while you aren't wearing armor or wielding a shield, your base AC equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Constitution modifier.</text>
			</feature>
			<feature optional="YES">
				<name>Order of the Nomad</name>
				<text>Mystics of the Order of the Nomad keep their minds in a strange, rarified state. They seek to accumulate as much knowledge as possible, as they quest to unravel the mysteries of the multiverse and seek the underlying structure of all things. At the same time, they perceive a bizarre, living web of knowledge they call the noosphere.</text>
				<text>Nomads, as their name indicates, delight in travel, exploration, and discovery. They desire to accumulate as much knowledge as possible, and the pursuit of secrets and hidden lore can become an obsession for them.</text>
				<text/>
				<text>Bonus Disciplines</text>
				<text>At 1st level, you learn two additional psionic disciplines of your choice. They must be chosen from among the Nomad disciplines.</text>
				<text/>

You can replace one or both of these selections with languages. This benefit lasts until you finish a long rest.</text>
			</feature>
			<feature optional="YES">
				<name>Order of the Soul Knife</name>
				<text>The Order of the Soul Knife sacrifices the breadth of knowledge other mystics gain to focus on a specific psionic technique. These mystics learn to manifest a deadly weapon of pure psychic energy that they can use to cleave through foes.</text>
				<text>	Soul knives vary widely in their approach to this path. Some follow it out of a desire to achieve martial perfection. Others are ruthless assassins who seek to become the perfect killer.</text>
				<text/>
				<text>Martial Training</text>
				<text>At 1st level, you gain proficiency with medium armor and martial weapons.</text>
				<text/>
				<text>Soul Knife</text>
				<text>Starting at 1st level, you gain the ability to manifest a blade of psychic energy. As a bonus action, you create scintillating knives of energy that project from both of your fists.</text>
				<text>	You can't hold anything in your hands while manifesting these blades. You can dismiss them as a bonus action.</text>
				<text>	For you, a soul knife is a martial melee weapon with the light and finesse properties. It deals 1d8 psychic damage on a hit.</text>
				<text>	As a bonus action, you can prepare to use the blades to parry; you gain a +2 bonus to AC until the start of your next turn or until you are incapacitated.</text>
			</feature>
			<feature optional="YES">
				<name>Order of the Wu Jen</name>
				<text>The Order of the Wu Jen features some of the most devoted mystics. These mystics seek to lock themselves away from the world, denying the limits of the physical world and replacing it with a reality that they create for themselves. Known as wu jens, these mystics cast their minds into the world, seize control of its fundamental principles, and rebuild it.</text>
				<text>	In practical terms, wu jens excel at controlling the forces of the natural world. They can hurl objects with their minds, control the four elements, and alter reality to fit their desires.</text>
				<text/>
				<text>Bonus Disciplines</text>
				<text>At 1st level, you learn two additional psionic disciplines of your choice. They must be chosen from among the Wu Jen disciplines.</text>
				<text/>

				<name>Mystical Recovery</name>
				<text>Starting at 2nd level, you can draw vigor from the psi energy you use to power your psionic disciplines.</text>
				<text>	Immediately after you spend psi points on a psionic discipline, you can take a bonus action to regain hit points equal to the number of psi points you spent.</text>
			</feature>
			<feature>
				<name>Telepathy</name>
				<text>At 2nd level, your mind awakens to the ability to communicate via telepathy. You can telepathically speak to any creature you can see within 120 feet of you in this manner. You don't need to share a language with the creature for it to understand your telepathic messages, but the creature must be able to understand at least one language or be telepathic itself.</text>

		<autolevel level="3">
			<feature optional="YES">
				<name>Avatar of Battle (Order of the Avatar)</name>

			</feature>
			<feature optional="YES">
				<name>Psionic Investigation (Order of the Awakened)</name>
				<text>Starting at 3rd level, you can focus your mind to read the psionic imprint left on an object. If you hold an object and concentrate on it for 10 minutes (as if concentrating on a psionic discipline), you learn a few basic facts about it. You gain a mental image from the object's point of view, showing the last creature to hold the object within the past 24 hours.</text>
				<text>	You also learn of any events that have occurred within 20 feet of the object within the past hour. The events you perceive unfold from the object's perspective. You see and hear such events as if you were there, but can't use other senses.</text>
				<text>	Additionally, you can embed an intangible psionic sensor within the object. For the next 24 hours, you can use an action to learn the object's location relative to you (its distance and direction) and to look at the object's surroundings from its point of view as if you were there. This perception lasts until the start of your next turn.</text>
				<text>Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</text>
			</feature>
			<feature optional="YES">
				<name>Psionic Resilience (Order of the Immortal)</name>
				<text>Starting at 3rd level, your psionic energy grants you extraordinary fortitude. At the start of each of your turns, you gain temporary hit points equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 0) if you have at least 1 hit point.</text>
			</feature>
			<feature optional="YES">
				<name>Memory of One Thousand Steps (Order of the Nomad)</name>
				<text>At 3rd level, you gain the ability to use psionics to recall your steps. As a reaction when you are hit by an attack, you can teleport to an unoccupied space that you occupied since the start of your last turn, and the attack misses you. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</text>
			</feature>
			<feature optional="YES">
				<name>Hone the Blade (Order of the Soul Knife)</name>
				<text>Starting at 3rd level, you can spend psi points to augment your soul knife's attack rolls and damage. You gain a bonus to attack and damage rolls with your soul knives depending on the number of psi points spent, as shown on the table below. This bonus lasts for 10 minutes.</text>
				<text>Attack and Damage Psi Points Bonus</text>
				<text>   Psi   -   Att and Dmg bonus</text>
				<text>   2	 -	 +1</text>
				<text>   5	 -	 +2</text>
				<text>   7	 -	 +4</text>
			</feature>
			<feature optional="YES">
				<name>Elemental Attunement (Order of the Wu Jen)</name>
				<text>Starting at 3rd level, when a creature's resistance reduces the damage dealt by a psionic discipline of yours, you can spend 1 psi point to cause that use of the discipline to ignore the creature's resistance. You can't spend this point if doing so would increase the discipline's cost above your psi limit.</text>
			</feature>
		</autolevel>
		<autolevel level="4">
			<feature>
				<name>Ability Score Improvement</name>
				<text>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</text>
				<text>	If your DM uses the optional Feats, you can instead take a feat.</text>
			</feature>
			<feature>
				<name>Strength of Mind</name>
				<text>Even the simplest psionic technique requires a deep understanding of how psionic energy can augment mind and body. This understanding allows you to alter your defenses to better deal with threats.</text>
				<text>	Starting at 4th level, you can replace your proficiency in Wisdom saving throws whenever you finish a short or long rest. To do so, choose Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, or Charisma. You gain proficiency in saves using that ability, instead of Wisdom. This change lasts until you finish your next short or long rest.</text>
