                <name>Psionic Talents</name>
                <text>A psionic talent is a minor psionic effect you have mastered. At 1st level, you know one psionic talent of your choice. You learn additional talents of your choice at higher levels.  The Talents Known column of the Mystic table shows the total number of talents you know at each level; when that number goes up for you, choose a new talent.</text>

                <text>You have an internal reservoir of energy that can be devoted to psionic disciplines you know. This energy is represented by psi points. Each psionic discipline describes effects you can create with it by spending a certain number of psi points. A psionic talent requires no psi points.</text>
                <text>    The number of psi points you have is based on your mystic level, as shown in the Psi Points column of the Mystic table. The number shown for your level is your psi point maximum. Your psi point total returns to its maximum when you finish a long rest. The number of psi points you have can’t go below 0 or over your maximum.</text>

                <name>Psi Limit</name>
                <text>Though you have access to a potent amount of psionic energy, it takes training and practice to channel that energy. There is a limit on the number of psi points you can spend to activate a psionic discipline. The limit is based on your mystic level, as shown in the Psi Limit column of the Mystic table. For example, as a 3rd-level mystic, you can spend no more than 3 psi points on a discipline each time you use it, no matter how many psi points you have.</text>

                <text>You can focus psionic energy on one of your psionic disciplines to draw ongoing benefits from it. As a bonus action, you can choose one of your psionic disciplines and gain its psychic focus benefit, which is detailed in that discipline’s description. The benefit lasts until you are incapacitated or until you use another bonus action to choose a different focus benefit.</text>
                <text>    You can have only one psychic focus benefit at a time, and using the psychic focus of one discipline doesn’t limit your ability to use other disciplines.</text>

            <feature>
                <name>Using Disciplines</name>
                <text>Each psionic discipline has several ways you can use it, all contained in its description. The discipline specifies the type of action and number of psi points it requires. It also details whether you must concentrate on its effects, how many targets it affects, what saving throws it requires, and so on.</text>
                <text>    The following sections go into more detail on using a discipline. Psionic disciplines are magical and function similarly to spells.</text>
                <text />
                <text>Psychic Focus</text>
                <text>The Psychic Focus section of a discipline describes the benefit you gain when you choose that discipline for your psychic focus.</text>
                <text />
                <text>Effect Options and Psi Points</text>
                <text>A discipline provides different options for how to use it with your psi points. Each effect option has a name, and the psi point cost of that option appears in parentheses after its name. You must spend that number of psi points to use that option, while abiding by your psi limit. If you don’t have enough psi points left, or the cost is above your psi limit, you can’t use the option.</text>
                <text>    Some options show a range of psi points, rather than a specific cost. To use that option, you must spend a number of points within that point range, still abiding by your psi limit. Some options let you spend additional psi points to increase a discipline’s potency. Again, you must abide by your psi limit, and you must spend all the points when you first use the discipline; you can’t decide to spend additional points once you see the discipline in action.</text>
                <text>    Each option notes specific information about its effect, including any action required to use it and its range.</text>
                <text />
                <text>Components</text>
                <text>Disciplines don’t require the components that many spells require. Using a discipline requires no spoken words, gestures, or materials. The power of psionics comes from the mind.</text>
                <text />
                <text>Duration</text>
                <text>    An option in a discipline specifies how long its effect lasts. Instantaneous: If no duration is specified, the effect of an option is instantaneous. Concentration: Some options require concentration to maintain their effects. This requirement is noted with “Conc” after the option’s psi point cost. The “Conc” notation is followed by the maximum duration of the concentration. For example, if an option says “Conc 1m”, you can concentrate on its effect for up to 1 minute, if an option says “Conc 1h,” you can concentrate on its effect for up to 1 hour, and finally if an option says "Conc 1r", you can concentrate on its effect for up to 1 round.</text>
                <text>    Concentrating on a discipline follows the same rules as concentrating on a spell. This rule means you can’t concentrate on a spell and a discipline at the same time, nor can you concentrate on two disciplines at the same time. See chapter 10, “Spellcasting,” in the Player’s Handbook for how concentration works.</text>
                <text />
                <text>Targets and Areas of Effect</text>
                <text>Psionic disciplines use the same rules as spells for determining targets and areas of effect. See chapter 10, “Spellcasting,” of the Player’s Handbook.</text>
                <text />
                <text>Saving Throws and Attack Rolls</text>
                <text>If a discipline requires a saving throw, it specifies the type of save and the results of a successful or failed saving throw. The DC is determined by your psionic ability.</text>
                <text>Some disciplines require you to make an attack roll to determine whether the discipline’s effect hits its target. The attack roll uses your psionic ability.</text>
                <text />
                <text>Combining Psionic Effects</text>
                <text>The effects of different psionic disciplines add together while the durations of those disciplines overlap. Likewise, different options from a single psionic discipline combine if they are active at the same time. However, a specific option from a psionic discipline doesn’t combine with itself if that option is used multiple times. Instead, the most potent effect &#8212; usually dependent on how many psi points were used to create the effect &#8212; applies while the durations of the effects overlap.</text>
                <text>    Psionics and magic are separate effects, and therefore their benefits and drawbacks overlap. A psionic effect that reproduces a spell is an exception to this rule (see “Psionics and Magic” earlier, as well as “Combining Magical Effects” in chapter 10, “Spellcasting,” of the Player’s Handbook).</text>

        <text>Whirlwind (2 psi):</text>
        <text>As an action, choose a point you can see within 60 feet of you. Winds howl in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on that point. Each creature in the sphere must succeed on a Strength saving throw or take 1d6 bludgeoning damage and be moved to an unoccupied space of your choice in the sphere. Any loose object in the sphere is moved to an unoccupied space of your choice within it if the object weighs no more than 100 pounds.</text>
        <text>Wall of Thunder (6 psi Conc 10m):</text>
        <text>As an action, you create a wall of thunder, at least one portion of which must be within 60 feet of you. The wall is 60 feet long, 15 feet high, and 1 foot thick. The wall lasts until your concentration ends. Every foot moved through the wall costs 1 extra foot of movement. When a creature moves into the wall’s space for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, that creature must succeed on a Strength saving throw, or it takes 6d6 thunder damage, is pushed in a straight line up to 30 feet away from the wall, and is knocked prone.</text>
        <text>Thunder Clap (7 psi):</text>
        <text>As an action, choose a point you can see within 60 feet of you. Thunder energy erupts in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on that point.

        <text>As an action, your mind seizes control of a one-handed melee weapon you’re holding. The weapon flies toward one creature you can see within 30 feet of you and makes a one-handed melee weapon attack against it, using your discipline attack modifier for the attack and damage rolls.

        <text>You cast your mind about for information about a specific creature. If you concentrate for this option’s full duration, you then gain a general understanding of the creature’s current location.

        <text>Defensive Step (2 psi):</text>

        <text>As an action, you create a 5-foot cube of dim, gray light within 5 feet of you.

        <text>As an action, you ask a question of one creature that can see and hear you within 30 feet of you. The question must be phrased so that it can be answered with a yes or no, otherwise this ability fails. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw, or it replies with a truthful answer. A creature is immune to this ability if it is immune to being charmed.</text>
        <text>Ransack Mind (5 psi Conc 1h):</text>

        <text>While you concentrate on this ability, you probe one creature’s mind. The creature must remain within 30 feet of you, and you must be able to see it. If you reach the ability’s full duration, the target must make three Intelligence saving throws, and you plant a memory or an idea in it, which lasts for a number of hours based on the number of saving throws it fails. You choose whether the idea or memory is trivial (such as “I had porridge for breakfast” or “Ale is the worst”) or personality-defining (“I failed to save my village from orc marauders and am therefore a coward” or “Magic is a scourge, so I renounce it”).</text>
        <text>    With one failed saving throw, the idea or memory lasts for the next 4 hours. With two failed saving throws, it lasts for 24 hours. With three failed saving throws, it lasts for 48 hours.</text>
