				<name>Roguish Archetype: Mastermind</name>

				<text>Starting at 3rd level, you can use the Help action as a bonus action. Additionally, when you use the Help action to aid an ally in attacking a creature, the target of that attack can be within 30 feet of you, rather than 5 feet of you, if the target can see or hear you.</text>

				<name>Mastermind: Insightful Manipulator</name>
				<text>Starting at 9th level, if you spend at least 1 minute observing or interacting with another creature outside combat, you can learn certain information about its capabilities compared to your own. The DM tells you if the creature is your equal, superior, or inferior in regard to two of the following characteristics of your choice:</text>
				<text/>
				<text>- Intelligence score</text>
				<text>- Wisdom score</text>
				<text>- Charisma score</text>
				<text>- Class levels (if any)</text>
				<text/>
				<text>	At the DM's option, you might also realize you know a piece of the creature's history or one of its personality traits, if it has any.</text>

			<feature optional="YES">
				<name>Mastermind: Misdirection</name>
				<text>Beginning at 13th level, you can sometimes cause another creature to suffer an attack meant for you.

			<feature optional="YES">
				<name>Mastermind: Soul of Deceit</name>
				<text>Starting at 17th level, your thoughts can't be read by telepathy or other means, unless you allow it. You can present false thoughts by making a Charisma (Deception) check contested by the mind reader's Wisdom (Insight) check.</text>
				<text>	Additionally, no matter what you say, magic that would determine if you are telling the truth indicates you are being truthful, if you so choose, and you can't be compelled to tell the truth by magic.</text>
