		<trait>
			<name>Feature: Legal Authority</name>
			<text>You have the authority to enforce the laws of Ravnica, and that status inspires a certain amount of respect and even fear in the populace. People mind their manners in your presence and avoid drawing your attention; they assume you have the right to be wherever you are. Showing your Azorius insignia gets you an audience with anyone you want to talk to (though it might cause more problems than it solves when you're dealing with incorrigible lawbreakers). If you abuse this privilege, though, you can get in serious trouble with your superiors and even be stripped of your position.</text>

			<text>You have more than one identity. The one you wear most of the time makes you appear to bea member of a guild other than House Dimir. You have documentation, established acquaintances, and disguises that allow you to assume that persona and fit into the secondary guild.</text>
			<text>	Whenever you choose, you can drop this identity and blend into the guildless masses of the city.</text>
			<text>	Consider why you're embedded in the secondary guild. Create a story with your DM, inspired by rolling on the following table or choosing a reason that suits you.</text>
			<text/>
			<text>d8  Reason for Infiltration</text>
			<text>1   My parents belong to this guild, and I let them think I'm following in their footsteps.</text>
			<text>2   I've been assigned to track this guild's activities.</text>
			<text>3   I've been assigned to get close to an individual in this guild and learn their secrets.</text>
			<text>4   I've been assigned to recruit a new Dimir spy from the ranks of this guild.</text>
			<text>5   I was a member of this guild before the Dimir recruited me.</text>
			<text>6   I don't like what this guild stands for and want to destroy it from within.</text>
			<text>7   I secretly wish I could leave the Dimir and join this guild, but there is no escaping the Dimir.</text>

			<name>Feature: Undercity Paths</name>
			<text>You know hidden, underground pathways that you can use to bypass crowds, obstacles, and observation as you move through the city. When you aren't in combat, you and companions you lead can travel between any two lo- cations in the city twice as fast as your speed would normally allow. The paths of the undercity are haunted by dangers that rarely brave the light of the surface world, so your journey isn't guaranteed to be safe.</text>

		</text>
		</trait>
		<trait>
			<name>Feature: Urban Infrastructure</name>
			<text>The popular conception of the Izzet League is based on mad inventions, dangerous experiments, and ex- plosive blasts. Much of that perception is accurate, but the league is also involved with mundane tasks of construction and architecture- primarily in crafting the infrastructure that allows Ravnicans to enjoy running water, levitating platforms, and other magical and technological wonders.</text>
			<text>	You have a basic knowledge of the structure of buildings, including the stuff behind the walls. You can also find blueprints of a specific building in order to learn the details of its construction. Such blueprints might provide knowledge of entry points, structural weaknesses, or secret spaces. Your access to such information isn't unlimited. If obtaining or using the information gets you in trouble with the law, the guild can't shield you from the repercussions.</text>

		</text>
		</trait>
		<trait>
			<name>Feature: Leverage</name>
			<text>You can exert leverage over one or more individuals below you in the guild's hierarchy and demand their help as needs warrant. For example, you can have a message carried across a neighborhood, procure a short carriage ride without paying, or have others clean up a bloody mess you left in an alley. The DM decides if your demands are reasonable and if there are subordinates available to fulfill them. As your status in the guild improves, you gain influence over more people, including ones in greater positions of power.</text>

You can get away with minor criminal offenses, such as refusing to pay for food at a restaurant or breaking down a door at a local shop, if no legal authorities witness the crime. Most people are too daunted by you to report your wrongdoing to the Azorius.</text>

			<text>When you attempt to learn or recall a magical or scientific fact, if you don't know that information, you know where and from whom you can obtain it. Usually, this information comes from a Simic laboratory, or sometimes from an Izzet facility, a library, a university, or an independent scholar or other learned person or creature. Knowing where the information can be found doesn't automatically enable you to learn it; you might need to offer bribes, favors, or other incentives to induce people to reveal their secrets.</text>
			<text>	Your DM might rule that the knowledge you seek is secreted away in an inaccessible place, or that it simply can't be found. Unearthing the deepest secrets of the multiverse can require an adventure or even a whole campaign.</text>
