<trait>
<name>Alu-Demons</name>
<text>Alu-Demons are horrid creatures, the progeny of one mortal and one demon parent. Distrust against these beings usually serves as a means of self-preservation for most people, rather than prejudice.</text>
  <text  />
  <text>Alu-Demons of this bloodline descend from or are the direct spawn of the Demon Lords. These Lords include, but aren't limited to: Fraz-Urb'luu, Graz'zt, Orcus, Demogorgon, and Yeenoghu</text>
  </trait>
  <trait>
    <name>Monstrous At Best</name>
    <text> While most physical characteristics differ between Alu-Demons depending on the nature of their demonic lineage, all share a few basic traits. Alu-Demons are bipedal and roughly humanoid in appearance. Their facial features are a mix of both their mundane, mortal bloodline, and the horrifying demonic visage: For example, an elven Alu-Demon may retain the pointed ears of their people, but also possess the blackened skin and curved forehead-mounted horn of a Babau. A human Alu-Demon may have fair white skin, with the compound, bug-like eyes of the Chasme. The more mundane Alu-Demons are sometimes mistaken for Tieflings; however, Alu-Demon traits tend to be much more gruesome and bizarre than their infernal cousins. Other examples of demonic traits include sharpened claws, an exterior skull, gray, black, or green skin, ram horns, boney protrusions, or a leathery tail. </text>
  </trait>
  <trait>
    <name>Progeny of the Abyss</name>
    <text>Alu-Demons are, by nature, cruel, vicious beings, with the taint of a demonic bloodline corrupting everything they do. While an Alu-Demon is all too happy to kill, maim, and destroy on a whim, working with a team of adventurers requires a bit more coercion.</text>
    <text  />
    <text>Alu-Demons are highly motivated by greed, lust, and the baser impulses. While an Alu-Demon will happily annihilate a team of Orcs attacking the village, the difficulty is in stopping the Alu-Demon from annihilating the village, too. Adventuring teams may find them difficult to work with unless they maintain sufficient bribes in the form of treasure and promises of future slaughters. </text>
  </trait>
  <trait>
    <name>Society</name>
    <text>On the mortal planes, Alu-Demons tend to integrate with already established communities in which their parents live. If too outlandish appearing, or if the natives are superstitious enough, they can be exiled. Pure Alu-Demon communities are few and lacking in structural economies, although they can exist. </text>
    <text  />
    <text>In the Abyss, however, Alu-Demons fit in quite well with the savage nature of the realm. They tend to stick close to parents, either in cooperation or in service. Alu-Demons traveling alone in the Abyss tend to naturally gravitate towards a Layer holding their own kind. </text>
  </trait>
  <trait>
    <name>Alu-Demon Names</name>
    <text>Alu-Demons are often proud of their heritage and will name themselves either partially or entirely after other demon species. Other Alu-Demons will base their names on the Abyssal root words for evil or immoral concepts. Almost all Alu-Demons pride their names on being difficult or uncomfortable to speak and pronounce. </text>

  <text  />

Obyrinth Alu-Demons may fare from the Far Realms, or from the deepest, unnamed layers of the Abyss. Residents of these locations include Lord Dagon, Cthulhu, dretches, hezrous, krakens, and many others.</text>
