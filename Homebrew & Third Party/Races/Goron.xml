 <trait>
  <name>Physiology</name>
  <text>Built like mountains, eating rocks, wading through lava -- Gorons are nothing if not hardy and impregnable.</text>
	<text  />
	<text>Gorons stand taller and wider than hylians, and universally have skin of an orange-brown hue. What little "hair" they possess is so stiff and thick it resembles solid rock, and usually grows only high on a goron's scalp and across its upper back. A few gorons are also able to grow beards or other facial hair, especially if they are of advanced age. A pair of goron eyes are wide set, perfectly circular, and completely dark—possessing no whites like those of a hylian's or gerudo's eyes. Goron noses are flat. Jaws are very wide, powerful, and composed entirely of molars—used to crush and pulverize the rocks which famously make up goron diets. </text>
  <text  />
  <text>Although they are physiologically more similar to earth elementals than mammals, gorons nonetheless take a humanoid shape. They are required to eat and sleep to live. Drinking serves no purpose for them. They can persist indefinitely without breathing, but doing so is unpleasant, especially when the goron is exerting itself. Mysteriously, gorons dine on rocks and other solid minerals—tastes vary between tribes, as some prefer coarse ores, others savor gemstones, but they generally dislike less solid earth such as sand or dirt. A few dine on more traditional foods such as meat or mushrooms, but this seems to be for pleasure rather than sustenance. </text>
  <text  />
  <text>Because they are literally made of rock, gorons have an inherent durability to their bodies, but are also particularly dense and heavy. This makes traditional movement difficult for them over anything but short distances. When traveling more than a few feet, a goron will usually tuck itself into a ball and roll, which allows it to traverse ground at much greater speed. This speed of this "goron roll" combined with a goron's weight makes it a powerful charging attack for chasing down foes. Aside from this, gorons battle with powerful punches—punches so powerful that fighting unarmed is the norm in their race. </text>
  <text  />
  <text>Gorons only possess one apparent sex, which they universally refer to as male. "Brother" is a very common term of endearment among them, and friends of a goron tribe are often referred to as brothers—regardless of whether or not they are male. </text>
 </trait>
 <trait>
   <name>Society</name>
	 <text>Living underground and inside of cavernous hills, your people are well adapted to subterranean life. Cave gorons are generally more sociable with other races, and are significantly more populous than their mountainous counterparts. </text>
	 <text  />
   <text>Goron cities and villages are almost universally built into caves or the sides of mountains, where the tastiest and most nutritious rocks are abundant. Their reliance on eating rocks makes their cultures particularly dependent on mining to survive, to the extent that the majority of gorons have experience in this profession. Many anthropologists believe gorons evolved to be as physically powerful and enduring as they are due to their race's inherent dependency on mining. Stronger gorons with greater strength made better miners, which enabled them to better survive and provide for their kin. </text>
   <text  />
<text>Due to their mining dependency, goron culture heavily involves stonework and the working of metals. Blacksmiths are abundant among them, and their structures are constructed almost entirely of metal. They're also one of few races that have widely adopted the use of explosive powder, and when in battle they often make use of bombs or other explosives. Their resistance to heat gives them an edge over most foes when using such powerful, but esoteric weapons. </text>
<text  />
<text>Gorons almost always place a high degree of value on physical strength and stamina, pride, honesty, and trustworthiness. Gorons most readily get along with races which share these values, usually including the like of subrosians, rito, and most hylians. A friend is rarely lost on a goron unless that friend is caught in a lie. Unsurprisingly, gorons often have a difficult time with people from less prideful cultures. </text>

<trait>
<name>Goron Names</name>
<text>Although gorons only have one gender, all goron names are all considered male. These names more often than not consist of at least one "go" or "da" syllable. Deep vowel sounds such as "ah," "oh," and "oo" are prominent. "R" consonants are also very common, especially in the center of the name. </text>
