			<name>Undead Fortitude</name>
			<text>If damage reduces the nihileth to 0 hit points, it must make a Constitution saving throw with a DC of 5 + the damage taken, unless the damage is radiant or from a critical hit. On a success, the nihileth drops to 1 hit point instead.</text>
		</trait>
		<trait>
			<name>Dual State</name>
			<text>A nihileth exists upon the Material Plane in one of two forms and can switch between them at will. In its material form, it has resistance to damage from nonmagical weapons. In its ethereal form, it is immune to damage from nonmagical weapons. The creature's ethereal form appears as a dark purple outline of its material form, with a blackish-purple haze within. A nihileth in ethereal form can move through air as though it were water, with a fly speed of 40 feet.</text>
		</trait>
		<trait>
			<name>Void Aura</name>
			<text>The undead nihileth is surrounded by a chilling cloud. A living creature that starts its turn within 5 feet of a nihileth must make a successful DC 14 Constitution saving throw or be slowed until the start of its next turn. In addition, any creature that has been diseased by a nihileth or a nihilethic zombie takes 7 (2d6) cold damage every time it starts its turn within the aura.</text>
		</trait>
		<trait>
			<name>Infecting Telepathy</name>
			<text>If a creature communicates telepathically with the nihileth, or uses a psychic attack against it, the nihileth can spread its disease to the creature. The creature must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom save or become infected with the same disease caused by the nihileth's tentacle attack.</text>
		</trait>
		<trait>
			<name>Nihileth's Lair</name>
			<text>On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the nihileth can take a lair action to create one of the magical effects as per an aboleth, or the void absorbance action listed below. The nihileth cannot use the same effect two rounds in a row.</text>
			<text>- Void Absorbance: A nihileth can pull the life force from those it has converted to nihilethic zombies to replenish its own life. This takes 18 (6d6) hit points from zombies within 30 feet of the nihileth, spread evenly between the zombies, and healing the nihileth. If a zombie reaches 0 hit points from this action, it perishes with no Undead Fortitude saving throw.</text>

If the target creature is hit, it must make a successful DC 14 Constitution saving throw or become diseased. The disease has no effect for 1 minute; during that time, it can be removed by lesser restoration or comparable magic. After 1 minute, the diseased creature's skin becomes translucent and slimy. The creature cannot regain hit points unless it is entirely underwater, and the disease can only be removed by heal or comparable magic. Unless the creature is fully submerged or frequently doused with water, it takes 6 (1d12) acid damage every 10 minutes. If a creature dies while diseased, it rises in 1d6 rounds as a nihilethic zombie. This zombie is permanently dominated by the nihileth.</text>

The charmed target is under the nihileth's control and can't take reactions, and the nihileth and the target can communicate telepathically with each other over any distance. Whenever the charmed target takes damage, the target can repeat the saving throw. On a success, the effect ends.

		<trait>
			<name>Spellcasting</name>
			<text>The chelicerae is an 8th-level spellcaster. Its spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 13, +5 to hit with spell attacks). It requires no material components to cast its spells. The chelicerae has the following wizard spells prepared:</text>
			<text>Cantrips: acid splash, mage hand, minor illusion, true strike</text>
			<text>1st level: burning hands, detect magic, expeditious retreat, ray of sickness</text>
			<text>2nd level: hold person, invisibility, scorching ray</text>
			<text>3rd level: animate dead, haste, lightning bolt</text>
			<text>4th level: phantasmal killer</text>
		</trait>
		<trait>
			<name>Siphon Spell Slots</name>
			<text>The chelicerae cannot replenish its spells naturally. Instead, it uses grappled spellcasters as spell reservoirs, draining uncast spells to power its own casting. Whenever the chelicerae wishes to cast a spell, it consumes a number of spell slots from its victim equal to the spell slots necessary to cast the spell. If the victim has too few spell slots available, the chelicerae cannot cast that spell. The chelicerae can also draw power from drained spellcasters or creatures without magic ability. It can reduce a grappled creature's Wisdom by 1d4, adding 2 spell slots to its spell reservoir for every point lowered. A creature reduced to 0 Wisdom is unconscious until it regains at least one point, and can't offer any more power. A creature regains all lost Wisdom when it finishes a long rest.</text>

			<name>Qorgeth's Lair</name>
			<text>On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), Qorgeth takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; Qorgeth can’t use the same effect two rounds in a row:</text>
			<text>- Until initiative count 20 on the following round, Qorgeth twists space through the tunnels of its lair. Any creature other than a demon that tries to move must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or move half its speed in a random direction before getting its bearings; it can then finish moving as it wants.</text>
			<text>- A section of ceiling in the lair collapses, raining debris onto a 20-foot-radius area. Each creature in the area must make a successful DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 18 (4d8) bludgeoning damage and be restrained until the end of its next turn.</text>
			<text>- Thick tangles of demonic worms erupt in the space of up to three creatures Qorgeth can see within 60 feet. Each targeted creature is attacked once by the worms (Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 0 ft., one target; Hit: 14 (4d6) piercing).</text>
		</trait>
		<trait>
			<name>Regional Effects</name>
			<text>The region containing Qorgeth’s lair is warped by the demon lord’s magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:</text>
			<text>- Tunnels within 5 miles of the lair attract all manner of worms and vermin, including purple worms. These creatures are ravenous and violent.</text>
			<text>- Within 1 mile of the lair, food rots and spontaneously erupts with maggots. One day worth of food carried by creatures spoils every 24 hours it remains in the area. It is impossible to forage for food in this area.</text>
			<text>- Dead bodies within 1 mile of the lair decay quickly. Any corpse is reduced to bones in 24 hours. Magic that prevents decay staves off this decomposition normally. Anointing the body with holy water prevents decomposition for one day but no longer.</text>
			<text>If Qorgeth dies, conditions in the area surrounding the lair return to normal over the course of 1d10 days.</text>

			<text>Melee Weapon Attack: +16 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 22 (2d12 + 9) piercing damage. A target creature of Large size or smaller must succeed on a DC 24 Dexterity saving throw or be swallowed by Qorgeth. A swallowed creature is blinded and restrained, and takes 16 (3d10) necrotic damage at the start of each of Qorgeth's turns. Qorgeth can have any number of creatures swallowed at one time. If Qorgeth takes 50 damage or more in a single turn from a creature it has swallowed, it must succeed on a DC 20 Constitution saving throw or regurgitate all swallowed creatures, who land prone within 10 feet of Qorgeth. If Qorgeth dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained, and can escape the corpse by spending 30 feet of movement, exiting prone.</text>

			<name>Enchanted Cage</name>
			<text>The iron cage that holds the fetal savant provides cover for the creature. The cage (AC 19, 10 hp) is considered an equipped object when borne by a derro and cannot be attacked directly. In addition, the cage protects the occupant from up to 20 spell levels of spells 4th level or lower but provides no protection to those outside of the cage. Spells of level 5 or higher take full, normal effect against the cage and its occupant. Once the cage protects against 20 or more spell levels it is rendered non-magical. If exposed to direct sunlight for over one hour of cumulative time it is destroyed.</text>
		</trait>
		<trait>
			<name>Madness</name>
			<text>A derro fetal savant's particular madness grants it immunity to psychic effects. It cannot be restored to sanity by any means short of a wish spell or comparable magic. A derro fetal savant brought to sanity gains 4 points of Wisdom and loses 6 points of Charisma.</text>
		</trait>
		<trait>
			<name>Vulnerability to Sunlight</name>
			<text>A derro fetal savant takes 1 point of Constitution damage for every hour it is exposed to sunlight, and it dies if its Constitution score reaches 0. Lost Constitution points are recovered at the rate of 1/day spent underground or otherwise sheltered from the sun.</text>
		</trait>
		<action>
			<name>Babble</name>
			<text>The sight of potential host bodies so excites the fetal savant that it babbles and giggles madly and childishly, creating an insanity effect. All sane creatures that start their turns within 60 feet of the fetal savant must succeed on a DC 13 Charisma saving throw or be affected by confusion (as the spell) for 1d4 rounds. This is a psychic effect. Creatures that successfully save cannot be affected by the same fetal savant's babbling for 24 hours. This action cannot be taken when the fetal savant is using Soul Exchange.</text>
		</action>
		<action>
			<name>Soul Exchange</name>
			<text>As an action, the fetal savant can attempt to take control of a creature it can see within 90 feet, forcing an exchange of souls as a magic jar spell, using its own body as the container. The fetal savant can use this power at will, but it can exchange souls with only one other creature at a time. The victim resists the attack with a successful DC 13 Charisma saving throw. A creature that successfully saves is immune to the same fetal savant's soul exchange for 24 hours. If the saving throw fails, the fetal savant takes control of the target's body and ferociously attacks nearby opponents, eyes blazing with otherworldly light. As an action, the fetal savant can shift from its host body back to its own, if it is within range, returning the victim's soul to its own body. If the host body or fetal savant is brought to 0 hit points within 90 feet of each other, the two souls return to their original bodies and the creature at 0 hit points is dying; it must make death saving throws until it dies, stabilizes, or regains hit points, as usual. If the host body or fetal savant is slain while they are more than 90 feet apart, their souls cannot return to their bodies and they are both slain. While trapped in the fetal savant's withered body, the victim is effectively paralyzed and helpless.</text>

			<text>Ia'Affrat can enter the body of an incapacitated or dead creature by crawling into its mouth and other orifices. Inhabiting requires 1 minute, and the victim must be Small, Medium, or Large. If Ia'Affrat inhabits a dead body, it can animate it and control its movements, effectively becoming a zombie for as long as it remains inside. Ia'Affrat can abandon the body as an action. Attacks against the host deal half damage to Ia'Affrat as well, but Ia'Affrat's resistances and immunities still apply against this damage. In a living victim, Ia'Affrat can control the victim's movement and actions as if using dominate monster (save DC 19) on the victim. Ia'Affrat can consume a living victim; the target takes 5 (2d4) necrotic damage per hour while Ia'Affrat inhabits its body, and Ia'Affrat regains hit points equal to the damage dealt. When inhabiting a body, Ia'Affrat can choose to have any spell it casts with a range of self, target the inhabited body rather than itself. The skin of a creature inhabited by Ia'Affrat crawls with the forms of the insects inside. Ia'Affrat can hide this telltale sign with a Charisma (Deception) check against a viewer's passive Insight.

			<name>Mammon's Lair</name>
			<text>On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), Mammon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; Mammon can’t use the same effect two rounds in a row:</text>
			<text>- Mammon infuses a pile of treasure in his lair with life. It becomes an earth elemental made of precious metals and gems. The elemental acts immediately and lasts until destroyed or until Mammon uses this action again.</text>
			<text>- Stacked piles of treasure shift and slide, collapsing onto a creature Mammon can see. The creature is restrained until initiative count 20 on the following round, or until it or an adjacent ally uses an action to make a successful DC 18 Strength check to free it.</text>
			<text>- Mammon magically teleports from one area of treasure to another within 150 feet.</text>
		</trait>
		<trait>
			<name>Regional Effects</name>
			<text>The region containing Mammon’s lair is warped by the archdevil’s magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:</text>
			<text>- Treasure in the possession of creatures other than Mammon turns to worthless materials such as lead, wood, or gravel, after spending 24 hours within 1 mile of the lair. The resulting junk resumes its valuable form when Mammon claims it, or by means of a wish spell or comparable magic.</text>
			<text>- Creatures that spend more than 1 hour within 1 mile of Mammon’s lair become obsessed with gaining the most generous payment or portion of wealth in any dealing unless they succeed on a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw. A creature that saves successfully is immune to this effect for 24 hours. The effect can be removed by a greater restoration spell or comparable magic.</text>
			<text>- Any naturally occurring treasure in Mammon’s home plane reverts to worthless junk if removed from the plane. Similarly, any mundane item left behind transforms into something fantastically valuable, as long as it remains on the plane.</text>
			<text> If Mammon dies, conditions in the area surrounding the lair return to normal over the course of 1d10 days.</text>

If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the creature is instantly petrified by being turned to solid gold. Otherwise, a creature that fails the saving throw is restrained. A restrained creature repeats the saving throw at the end of its next turn, becoming petrified on a failure or ending the effect on a success.

All devils have advantage on spell attacks made against the devil.marked creature, and the creature has disadvantage on saving throws made against spells and abilities used by devils. The mark can be removed by remove curse if the caster also makes a successful DC 23 spellcasting check. The mark reveals itself as desecrated to detect evil and good. It often shifts its position on the body, especially when it's concealed (and usually at the most inconvenient moment). Because such marks are sometimes placed on those who've made pacts with devils, NPC paladins and clerics might assume that any character bearing a devil's mark is in league with evil forces.</text>

The target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw (DC 13), or the affected creature gains a devil's mark.a black, red, or purple tattoo in the shape of an archduke's personal seal (most often Mammon or Totivillus but sometimes Arbeyach, Asmodeus, Beelzebub, Dispater, or others). All devils have advantage on spell attacks made against the devil-marked creature, and the creature has disadvantage on saving throws made against spells and abilities used by devils. The mark can be removed only by a remove curse spell or comparable magic. In addition, the mark detects as faintly evil and often shifts its position on the body. Paladins, witchfinders, and some clerics may consider such a mark proof that a creature has made a pact with a devil.</text>

			<text>A doppelrat under duress creates clones of itself at the beginning of its turn. Each round for 4 rounds, the number of live doppelrats quadruples but never exceeds 20. For example, when the doppelrat triggers arcane doubling, 1 rat becomes 4; at the start of the rat's next turn, those 4 become 16; and at the start of the rat's third turn, those 16 become 20, the maximum allowed. If one of the duplicates was destroyed between the original doppelrat's 1st and 2nd turns, then the surviving 3 would become 12, and so on. Each duplicate appears in the same space as any other rat, can either move or take an action the round it appears, and has 4 hit points and AC 13. Any surviving duplicates perish 1 minute (10 rounds) after the first ones were created. If the original doppelrat dies, its clones stop duplicating but the preexisting clones remain until their time expires. A creature can identify the original doppelrat from its duplicates as an action by making a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Nature) or Wisdom (Perception) check.</text>

			<name>Flame Dragon's Lair</name>
			<text>On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the dragon can’t use the same effect two rounds in a row.</text>
			<text>- A cloud of smoke swirls in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. The cloud spreads around corners and the area is lightly obscured. Each creature in the cloud must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be blinded for 1 minute. A blinded creature repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.</text>
			<text>- The ground erupts with volcanic force at a point the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. Any creature within 20 feet of the point must make a successful DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone and trapped in the ground. A creature trapped in this way is restrained and can’t stand up. A creature can end the restraint if it or another creature takes an action to make a successful DC 15 Strength check.</text>
			<text>- A wall of fire rises up from the ground within 120 feet of the dragon. The wall is up to 60 feet long, 10 feet high, and 5 feet thick, can take any shape the dragon wants, and blocks line of sight. When the wall appears, each creature in its area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. A creature that fails the saving throw takes 21 (6d6) fire damage. Each creature that enters the wall for the first time each turn or ends its turn there takes 21 (6d6) fire damage. The wall is extinguished when the dragon uses this lair action again or when the dragon dies.</text>

			<text>- Temperatures rise within 6 miles of the lair. Crops wither, producing famines.</text>
			<text>- Sulfur geysers form in and around the dragon’s lair. Some of them erupt only once an hour, so they’re spotted only with a successful DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check. A creature on top of an erupting geyser takes 21 (6d6) fire damage, or half damage with a successful DC 15 Dexterity saving throw.</text>
			<text>If the dragon dies, the arguments and misunderstandings disappear immediately and the temperatures go back to normal within 1d10 days. Any geysers remain where they are.</text>

			<name>Sea Dragon's Lair</name>
			<text>On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action and generates one of the following effects. The dragon can’t use the same effect two rounds in a row:</text>
			<text>- Four vortexes, each 5 feet in diameter and up to 30 feet tall, appear within the lair where the dragon wishes. Creatures occupying the space where a vortex appears or who enter the vortex for the first time on a turn must make a DC 15 Dexterity save or be restrained. As an action, a creature can free itself or another creature from a vortex by succeeding on a DC 15 Strength check. The vortexes last until the dragon uses this lair action again or until the dragon dies.</text>
			<text>- The dragon creates a wall of living coral on a solid surface it can see within 120 feet of it. The wall can be up to 30 feet long, 30 feet high, and 1 foot thick. When the wall appears, each creature within its area takes damage as if touching the wall and is pushed 5 feet out of the wall’s space, on whichever side of the wall it wants. Touching the wall releases painful stings that deal 18 (4d8) poison damage, or half that with a successful DC 15 Constitution saving throw. Each 10-foot section of the wall has AC 5, 30 hit points, resistance to fire damage, and immunity to psychic damage. The wall lasts until the dragon uses this lair action again or until the dragon dies.</text>
			<text>- The dragon bends time around its enemies. Four creatures the dragon can see within 120 feet of it must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom save or be affected by a slow spell. This effect last until initiative count 20 on the following round.</text>

			<name>Void Dragon's Lair</name>
			<text>On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to generate one of the following effects; the dragon can’t use the same effect two rounds in a row:</text>
			<text>- The dragon negates natural gravity within its lair (an area affected by its gravitic breath is unaffected). Creatures drift 10 feet away from the ground over the course of a round and are restrained. Flying creatures can move at half speed, unless they have the (hover) tag or use magical flight, in which case they move normally. This effect persists until initiative count 20 on the following round.</text>
			<text>- The Void briefly overlaps the dragon’s lair in a 20-foot-radius sphere of blackness punctuated by deep blue streaks and pinpoints of light. The sphere is centered on a point the dragon can see within 120 feet of the dragon. The area spreads around corners, is heavily obscured, and contains no air (creatures must hold their breath). Each creature in the sphere when it appears must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 10 (3d6) cold damage on a failed save or half as much on a successful one. Any creature that ends its turn in the sphere takes 10 (3d6) cold damage. The sphere lasts until the dragon uses this lair action again or until the dragon dies.</text>
			<text>- The dragon rips the fabric of space, forcing two creatures it can see within 120 feet of it to suddenly exist in the same place. Space itself repels the creatures to their original positions. Each creature takes 16 (3d10) force damage and is knocked prone, or takes half as much damage and is not knocked prone with a successful DC 15 Strength saving throw.</text>

			<text>- Light is muted within 6 miles of the lair. Nonmagical illumination, including sunlight, can’t create bright light in this area.</text>
			<text>- Visitations from otherworldly beings occur and disembodied voices whisper in the night within 6 miles of the dragon’s lair. Celestials, fey, and fiends of CR 2 or lower can slip into the world in this area.</text>

			<text>Each creature of the dragon's choice that is within 120 feet of the dragon and aware of it must succeed on a DC 22 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. A creature repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature fails the saving throw by 5 or more it is driven insane. An insane creature is frightened permanently, and behaves as if affected by confusion while it is frightened in this way.

Since its coating of dust, sand, and gravel can't be hidden, it usually disguises itself as a terrain feature or eroded ruin. Its statistics are the same in each form. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying isn't transformed. It reverts to its true form if it dies.</text>

The target of the drift (but not the future self) must then make a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw, with effects identical to those for the eonic drifter witnessing the death of its future self (see Drift Backward). The future self doesn't reappear after using this ability the second time; only the target of the drift reappears from the second use. This does not trigger a saving throw for the present self.</text>

To recover from disorientation, a creature must start its turn outside the fear smith's gaze and make a successful DC 16 Wisdom saving throw. To use this ability, the fear smith can't be incapacitated and must see the affected creature. A creature that isn't surprised can avert its eyes at the start of its turn to avoid the effect. In that case, no saving throw is necessary but the creature treats the fear smith as invisible until the start of the creature's next turn. If during its turn the creature chooses to look at the fear smith, it must immediately make the saving throw.</text>

The bees remain until they’re killed or until the Bear King dismisses them as an action. The Bear King can use this action again, but no more than eight giant bees can be present at a time. </text>
			<text>- The Bear King targets a creature within the lair that he can see. The creature must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be magically transformed into a brown bear as if by a polymorph spell. At the beginning of its turn, a transformed creature repeats the saving throw. If it fails, the creature must use its action to attack one of the Bear King’s foes.

			<name>The Queen of Night and Magic's Lair</name>
			<text>On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the Queen of Night and Magic takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the Queen of Night and Magic can’t use the same effect two rounds in a row:</text>
			<text>- The Queen wills darkness to overpower the light. All bright light sources in the lair shed only dim light to their normal bright light radius, and dim light sources are extinguished. This lasts until the Queen dismisses the effect or dies.</text>
			<text>- An opaque wall of writhing shadows springs up from a solid surface within 120 feet of the Queen. The wall is up to 60 feet long, 10 feet high, and 5 feet thick. Each creature in the area must make a successful DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 18 (4d8) necrotic damage. Creatures in the wall’s space are pushed 5 feet out of the wall’s space, appearing on whichever side of the wall they choose. A creature can move through the wall, but the semimaterial shadow resists intrusion. For every foot a creature travels through the wall, it must spend 4 feet of movement. Furthermore, any creature that, during its own turn, occupies any part of the wall’s space takes 18 (4d8) necrotic damage, or half damage with a successful DC 15 Constitution saving throw. Each 10-foot section of wall has AC 5, 15 hit points, vulnerability to radiant damage, resistance to bludgeoning and piercing damage, and immunity to cold, poison, and psychic damage. The wall lasts until the Queen uses this lair action again, or until she dies.</text>
			<text>- The Queen targets one creature within 60 feet of her and assails its mind with visions of hopelessness and despair. The creature must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be stunned until initiative count 20 on the next round.</text>
		</trait>
		<trait>
			<name>Regional Effects</name>
			<text>The region containing the Queen of Night and Magic’s lair is warped by her magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:</text>
			<text>- Shadows come to life within 6 miles of the Queen’s lair. Most of the time these living shadows are unnerving and nothing more, but when a creature acts against the interests of the Queen, the shadows can interfere and cause any relevant die roll to be made with disadvantage.</text>
			<text>- Magic saturates the area within 6 miles of the lair, causing minor random effects similar to a prestidigitation cantrip.</text>
			<text>- The Queen of Night and Magic can cast her senses to any area containing darkness, dim light, or shadows within 6 miles of her lair, similar to a clairvoyance spell.</text>
			<text> While the Summer Court rules, the regional effects of the Queen’s lair extend into the Winter Palace, but they are diminished and weaker than normal. During the Winter Court’s reign, the Winter Palace is not subject to the regional effects. If the Queen of Night and Magic dies, conditions in the area surrounding the lair gradually return to normal over the course of 2d10 days.</text>

			<text>As an action, Nicnevin can cut a lock of her copper hair and twist it into a token for a creature she chooses. As long as that creature carries the token, it gains the magic resistance trait (see above). Nicnevin can revoke her favor at any time as a bonus action. When that happens, the creature loses the benefit of the token and, if Nicnevin wishes, the creature also has disadvantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects for 24 hours.</text>

		<trait>
			<name>The Queen of Witches's Lair</name>
			<text>On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), Nicnevin takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; Nicnevin can’t use the same effect two rounds in a row:</text>
			<text>- Nicnevin causes a searing flare of moonlight to burst from a point she can see within 100 feet. All creatures Nicnevin chooses within 30 feet of that point take 13 (3d8) radiant damage, or half damage with a successful DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. Creatures not in their natural form have disadvantage on the saving throw, and if they fail, they revert to their natural form immediately (this does not affect any shape-changing effect created by Nicnevin).</text>
			<text>- A wall of softly glowing crystal springs up from a solid surface in the lair. The wall is 60 feet long, 10 feet high, 5 feet thick, blocks line of sight, and sheds dim light out to 10 feet. Creatures within the wall’s area when it appears must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 14 (4d6) radiant damage. The creature is pushed out of the wall’s space to whichever side it chooses. Each 5-foot section of the wall has AC 15, 10 hit points, resistance to fire, slashing, and piercing damage, immunity to poison and psychic damage, and vulnerability to thunder. The wall lasts until Nicnevin uses this action again or dies.</text>
			<text>- Until initiative count 20 on the following round, any creatures other than fey who attempt to cast a spell must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or the spell fails and the spell slot is expended. A creature becomes aware of this effect the moment it begins casting a spell, and it can choose to take a different action instead.</text>

She may visit the supplicant and hear a request, especially if the request is repeated on multiple nights. For 24 hours after the invocation, Nicenvin has a connection to the area that allows her to target it with teleportation circle.</text>
			<text>- Despite the weather, the moon is always visible for most of the night within 10 miles of the lair. Cloud cover has many breaks, or the moon’s light sharply penetrates the clouds.</text>

			<text>- The fey river swells and rushes over the land, or the walls of the Hall buckle and allow the torrent in. The River King chooses a 10-foot-wide path up to 60 feet long. Each creature in the path of the water must make a DC 15 Strength saving throw. Creatures that fail the save are swept 20 feet down the path of the water and take 9 (2d8) bludgeoning damage.</text>
			<text>- The River King targets a creature he can see within 60 feet. That creature’s mouth and throat fill with river water. The creature must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a success, the creature manages to hold its breath, but on a failure, it begins to suffocate. A suffocating but conscious creature repeats the saving throw at the end of its turn, ending the effect on itself on a success.

			<text>Spread mainly through bite wounds, this rare disease makes itself known within 24 hours by swiftly debilitating the infected. A creature so afflicted must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw after every long rest. On a failed save the victim takes 14 (4d6) necrotic damage, and its hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. This reduction can't be removed until the victim recovers from darakhul fever, and even then only by greater restoration or similar magic. The victim recovers from the disease by making successful saving throws on two consecutive days. Greater restoration cures the disease; lesser restoration allows the victim to make the daily Constitution check with advantage. Primarily spread among humanoids, the disease can affect ogres, and therefore other giants may be susceptible.

			<text>On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), Hraesvelgr takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; Hraesvelgr can’t use the same effect two rounds in a row:</text>

			<text>- One creature within 60 feet that Hraesvelgr can see must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be swept up in a pillar of wind. The creature is restrained and suspended 15 feet off the ground. If the creature has something to pull on, it can pull itself out of the wind by using an action and making a successful DC 15 Strength check; another creature who can reach the suspended creature can pull it free in the same way. Alternatively, a flying creature can repeat the saving throw as an action. On a success, it moves 5 feet out of the pillar of wind. This effect lasts until Hraesvelgr takes this action again or dies.</text>
			<text>- Hraesvelgr lets out a thunderous bellow in giant form or an ear-splitting shriek in roc form. All creatures within 30 feet must make a successful DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be frightened for 1 minute.

			<text>The jester forces one Medium or Small humanoid within 60 feet to make a DC 17 Charisma saving throw. If the saving throw fails, the jester and the target exchange locations via teleportation and an illusion causes them to swap appearance: the jester looks and sounds like the target, and the target looks and sounds like the jester. The illusion lasts for 1 hour unless it is dismissed earlier by the jester as a bonus action, or dispelled (DC 17).</text>

All other creatures within 60 feet of the jester must make a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw. Those that fail fall prone in a fit of deadly laughter. The laughter lasts 1d4 rounds, during which time the victim is incapacitated and unable to stand up from prone. At the end of its turn each round, an incapacitated victim must make a successful DC 17 Constitution saving throw or be reduced to 0 hit points. The laughter can be ended early by rendering the victim unconscious or with greater restoration or comparable magic.</text>

While charmed by the harpy, a target is incapacitated and ignores the songs of other harpies. A charmed target that is more than 5 feet away from the harpy must move at its highest rate (including dashing, if necessary) along the most direct route to get within 5 feet of the harpy. The charmed creature doesn't maneuver to avoid opportunity attacks, but it can repeat the saving throw every time it takes damage from anything other than the harpy. It also repeats the saving throw before entering damaging terrain (lava or a pit, for example), if the most direct route includes a dangerous space. A creature also repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns.

			<name>Unleashed Emotion</name>
			<text>When a hulking whelp feels threatened - it's touched, intimidated, cornered, attacked, or even just if a stranger moves adjacent to the whelp - it immediately grows from size Small to Huge as a reaction. If the whelp was attacked, this reaction occurs after the attack is made but before damage is done. Nearby creatures and objects are pushed to the nearest available space and must make a successful DC 15 Strength saving throw or fall prone. Weapons, armor, and other objects worn or carried by the hulking whelp grow (and shrink again) proportionally when it changes size. Overcome by raw emotion, it sets about destroying anything and everything it can see (which isn't much) and reach (which is quite a lot). The transformation lasts until the hulking whelp is unaware of any nearby creatures for 1 round, it drops to 0 hit points, it has 5 levels of exhaustion, or it's affected by a calm emotions spell or comparable magic. The transformation isn't entirely uncontrollable; people or creatures the whelp knows and trusts can be near it without triggering the reaction.

			<name>Hidey-Hole</name>
			<text>When a kikimora chooses a house to inhabit, she scrawls a symbol on a wall, baseboard, cupboard, or semi.permanent object (like a stove) to be her tiny domain. This ability creates a hidden extra-dimensional dwelling. After creating a hidey-hole, a kikimora can teleport herself and up to 50 lb of objects to the designated location instead of making a normal move. This extradimensional space can only be entered by the kikimora or by a creature using a plane shift spell or ability. The location can be determined by casting detect magic in the area of the sigil, but it takes a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check to plane shift into the space. Inside the hidey-hole, a kikimora can see what is going on outside the space through a special sensor. This sensor functions like a window, and it can be blocked by mundane objects placed in front of the sigil. If she leaves an item in her space, it remains there even if she removes the sigil and places it in another location. If someone else removes the sigil, all contents are emptied into the Ethereal Plane (including any beings within her hidey-hole at the time). In this case, the kikimora can attempt a DC 15 Charisma saving throw to instead eject herself (but none of her possessions) into a space adjacent to the sigil.</text>

			<name>Koschei's Lair Actions</name>
			<text>On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), Koschei takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; Koschei can’t use the same effect two rounds in a row:</text>
			<text>- Koschei creates a whirlwind centered on a point he can see within 100 feet. The whirlwind is 10 feet wide and up to 50 feet tall. A creature in the area of the whirlwind when it’s created, or who enters the area for the first time on a turn, must make a DC 15 Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is restrained and takes 18 (4d8) bludgeoning damage from the buffeting wind. A restrained creature can escape from the
whirlwind by using its action to repeat the saving throw; on a success, it moves 5 feet outside the area of the whirlwind. The whirlwind lasts until Koschei uses this action again or dies.</text>
			<text>- Tortured spirits appear and attack up to three creatures Koschei can see within the lair. One attack is made against each targeted creature; each attack has +8 to hit and does 10 (3d6) necrotic damage.</text>
			<text>- Koschei disrupts the flow of magic in his lair. Until initiative count 20 on the following round, any creature other than a fiend who targets Koschei with a spell must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, the creature still casts the spell, but it must target a creature other than Koschei.</text>

			<text>- Wind and snowstorms are common within 5 miles of the lair.</text>
			<text>- Koschei is aware of any spell cast within 5 miles of his lair. He knows the source of the magic (innate, the caster’s class, or a magic item) and knows the direction to the caster.</text>

			<text>A mordant snare can control up to four bodies per tentacle. These "puppets" look and move like zombies. Treat each one as a zombie, but limited in movement to the 30-foot-by-30-foot area above the buried snare. Unlike normal zombies, any creature within 5 feet of a mordant puppet when the puppet takes piercing or slashing damage takes 3 (1d6) acid damage (spray from the wound). All puppets attached to a particular tentacle are destroyed if the mordant snare attacks with that tentacle; this does 9 (2d8) acid damage per puppet to all creatures within 5 feet of any of those puppets, or half damage with a successful DC 16 Dexterity saving throw. Damage done to puppet zombies doesn't affect the mordant snare. If the snare is killed, all of its puppets die immediately without causing any acid damage.</text>

If the nightgarm takes 25 damage or more on a single turn from the swallowed creature, the nightgarm must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate the creature, which falls prone within 5 feet of the nightgarm. If the nightgarm dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape from the corpse by using 10 feet of movement, exiting prone.</text>

Also, any cure spell cast on the blinded creature ends the temporary blindness, but not restoration spells. If a creature that's already temporarily blinded is targeted again by eye extraction and fails the saving throw, that creature becomes permanently blind as its eyes are pulled from their sockets to join the swarm (causing 1d8 piercing damage). Success on either saving throw renders that creature immune to eye extraction for 24 hours (but it still doesn't recover its sight until it gets out of the swarm).

The ostinato can't be targeted by any attack, spell, or other effect. The target retains control of its body and is aware of the ostinato's presence only as a melody, not as a living entity. The target no longer needs to eat or drink, gains the ostinato's Magic Resistance trait, and has advantage on Charisma checks. It also has disadvantage on Wisdom saving throws and it can't maintain concentration on spells or other effects for more than a single turn. The target can make a DC 13 Wisdom (Insight) check once every 24 hours; on a success, it realizes that the music it hears comes from an external entity. The Aural Symbiosis lasts until the target drops to 0 hit points, the ostinato ends it as a bonus action, or the ostinato is forced out by a dispel evil and good spell or comparable magic. When the Aural Symbiosis ends, the ostinato bursts forth in a thunderous explosion of sound and reappears in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the target. All creatures within 60 feet, including the original target, take 21 (6d6) thunder damage, or half damage with a successful DC 13 Constitution saving throw.

When the selang plays a tune on these pipes, all creatures within 60 feet must make a successful DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or be affected by contagion, confusion, irresistible dance, or hideous laughter, depending on what alien and otherworldly music the dark satyr chooses to play. A creature that saves successfully against this psychic effect is immune to the piping for 24 hours. The selang can use each of these spell-like effects once per day.</text>

			<text>The serpopard releases a jet of foul-smelling musk in a 15-foot cone that lasts for 2d4 rounds. Creatures in the cone must make DC 13 Dexterity saving throws. If the save succeeds, the creature moves to the nearest empty space outside the cone; if the saving throw fails, the creature becomes drenched in musk. A creature that enters the area of the cone while the musk persists is saturated automatically. A creature saturated in musk is poisoned. In addition, every creature that starts its turn within 5 feet of a saturated creature must make a successful DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned until the start of its next turn. Serpopard musk (and the poisoning) wear off naturally in 1d4 hours. A saturated creature can end the effect early by spending 20 minutes thoroughly washing itself, its clothes, and its equipment with water and soap.</text>

The target creature receives a +4 bonus to its Dexterity and Charisma scores while it's inhabited. The speech and actions of an inhabited creature are noticeably jerky and erratic to any creature with passive Perception 14 or higher. Each time the spark uses innate spellcasting, the host can attempt another DC 14 Charisma saving throw. A successful save expels the spark, which appears in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the former host. The inhabiting spark slowly burns out its host's nervous system.

			<text>The ancient titan opens a momentary rupture in the eldritch source that fuels its words of power. This rupture appears at a spot designated by the titan within 100 feet. Any creature within 60 feet of the spot must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the creature takes 28 (8d6) force damage, falls prone, and is pulled 1d6 x 10 feet toward the eldritch singularity, taking an additional 3 (1d6) bludgeoning damage per 10 feet they were dragged. If the saving throw succeeds, the target takes half as much force damage and isn't knocked prone or pulled. The spot where the rupture occurs becomes the center of a 60-foot-radius antimagic field until the end of the ancient titan's next turn. The titan's spells are not affected by this antimagic field.</text>

			<name>Earthstrike (Recharge 4-6)</name>

Each creature in the line takes 35 (10d6) force damage and is flung up 20 feet away from the titan and knocked prone; a successful DC 18 Dexterity saving throw halves the damage and prevents the creature from being flung or knocked prone. A creature that's flung against an unyielding object such as a wall or floor takes 3 (1d6) bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet it was thrown. If it collides with another creature, that creature must succeed on a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw or take the same damage (1d6 bludgeoning per 10 feet) and be knocked prone.</text>

			<name>Legendary Resistance (3/Day)</name>
			<text>If the hive-queen fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.</text>
		</trait>
		<trait>
			<name>Hive Mind</name>
			<text>The hive-queen is the psychic nexus for every tosculi in her hive. She is aware of the direction and distance to all members of the hive, can telepathically communicate with them when they are within 20 miles, and can sense what they sense when they are within 1 mile of her. Tosculi from her hive that travel more than 20 miles away instinctively know the direction and distance to the hive and try to return. Hive-queens sometimes dispatch rescue missions to recover separated members of the hive.</text>
		</trait>
		<trait>
			<name>Hive Queen Lair</name>
			<text>On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the hive-queen takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects:</text>
			<text>- The tosculi hive-queen releases a cloud of pheromones that drives the tosculi to fight harder. All tosculi within 60 feet of the hive-queen (including the hive-queen herself) regain 7 (2d6) hit points.</text>
			<text>- A swarm of tiny tosculi offspring crawls from its nest and attacks a creature within 120 feet of the hive-queen, automatically doing 10 (4d4) piercing damage. Then the swarm dies. </text>
			<text>- The ceiling above one creature that the hive-queen can see within 120 feet of her drips sticky resin. The creature must make a successful DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or be encased in rapidly-hardening resin. A creature encased this way is restrained. It can free itself, or another creature within 5 feet can free it, by using an action to make a successful DC 15 Strength check. If the creature is still encased the next time the initiative count reaches 20, the resin hardens, trapping it. The trapped creature can’t move or speak; attack rolls against it have disadvantage because it is encased in resin armor; it automatically fails Strength and Dexterity saving throws; and it has resistance to all damage. The trapped creature is released when the resin is destroyed (AC 10, 20 HP, immune to cold, fire, necrotic, poison, psychic, radiant, and piercing damage). </text>
			<text>The tosculi hive-queen can’t repeat an effect until they have all been used, and she can’t use the same effect two rounds in a row.</text>

			<text>- Beasts within 6 miles are more irritable and violent than usual and have the Blood Frenzy trait:The beast has advantage on melee attack rolls against a creature that doesn’t have all its hit points. </text>

			<name>Rootlet Swarms</name>
			<text>The vesiculosa is surrounded at all times by four Medium swarms of Tiny rootlets that move as the vesiculosa directs. Each swarm has a speed of 30 feet, can be targeted independently, has 25 hit points, and (unlike the parent plant) quite vulnerable to fire damage. Other than that, they have the same statistics as the vesiculosa's main body. For each swarm that drops to 0 hit points, the vesiculosa loses one of its Entrap attacks. A destroyed swarm regrows in 24 hours.</text>

			<name>Sweet Water</name>
			<text>The vesiculosa's pool emits a sweet fragrance that lures creatures to drink. Creatures that are neither undead nor constructs within 60 feet must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or be compelled to approach the vesiculosa and drink. The water is cool and refreshing but carries a sleeping poison: any creature (other than undead and constructs) that drinks from it regains 1d4 hp and recovers from 1 level of exhaustion, but must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw against poison or fall unconscious for 1 minute. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the creature is unconscious for 1 hour. An unconscious creature wakes up if it takes damage or if another creature uses an action to shake it awake.</text>

			<text>The vesiculosa targets a Large or smaller creature within 5 feet of one of its rootlet swarms. The target takes 10 (4d4) piercing damage and is grappled (escape DC 15), or takes half damage and isn't grappled if it makes a successful DC 17 Dexterity saving throw. Until the grapple ends, the target is restrained, it has disadvantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws, and that rootlet swarm can't entrap another target.</text>
		</action>
		<action>

			<text>Each rootlet swarm that has a creature grappled moves up to 20 feet toward the vesiculosa's main body. Rootlets wander up to 100 feet from the main body.</text>

		<action>
			<name>Engulf</name>
			<text>The vesiculosa engulfs all restrained or unconscious creatures within 5 feet of its main body (up to 2 Large, 4 Medium or 8 Small creatures). An engulfed creature is restrained, has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the vesiculosa, and takes 21 (6d6) acid damage at the start of each of the vesiculosa's turns. When the vesiculosa moves, the engulfed creature moves with it. An engulfed creature can try to escape by using an action to make a DC 15 Strength check. On a success, the creature escapes and enters a space of its choice within 5 feet of the vesiculosa's main body.</text>

While swallowed, the creature is blinded and restrained, it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the zimwi, and it takes 14 (4d6) acid damage at the start of each of the zimwi's turns. If the zimwi's stomach takes 20 damage or more on a single turn from a creature inside it, the zimwi must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate all swallowed creatures, which fall prone in a space within 5 feet of the zimwi. Damage done to a zimwi's stomach does not harm the zimwi. The zimwi's stomach is larger on the inside than the outside. It can have two Medium creatures or four Small or smaller creatures swallowed at one time. If the zimwi dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape from the corpse using 5 feet of movement, exiting prone.</text>

The target takes 25 (6d6 + 4) necrotic damage and its hit point maximum is reduced by an equal amount until the target finishes a long rest; a successful DC 17 Constitution saving throw prevents both effects. The vampire warlock regains hit points equal to half the damage dealt. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0.</text>
